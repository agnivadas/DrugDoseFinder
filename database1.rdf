   - 100-400 mg PO qDay in preparation for surgery initially
   - May be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective for patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery
Edematous Conditions:
   - Management of edema in patients with cirrhosis of the liver when edema are unresponsive to fluid and sodium restriction or nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, fluid restriction and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response
  Tablet:
   - 100 mg qDay or divided q12hr for 5 days initially; then adjust does based on patient response; range: 25-200 mg PO qDay or divided q12hr
  PO suspension:
   - 75 mg PO qDay or divided doses initially; if sole therapy, administer for ≥5 days before increasing dose to obtain effect

   - See Dosing Considerations
Congestive Heart Failure:
   - Indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (EF) to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure
   - ACC/AHA guidelines recommend aldosterone antagonist to be added to an ACE inhibitor or ARB, plus a beta-blocker; patient conditions may also require additional medications (eg, loop diuretics, hydralazine, nitrates, digoxin)
  Tablet:
   - 25mg/day PO initially if serum potassium ≤5 mEq/L and eGFR &gt;50 mL/min/1.73 m²; if tolerated, may increase to 50 mg/day as clinically indicated; if 25 mg/day not tolerated, reduce frequency to qoD
  PO suspension:

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Acute Liver Failure:
   - Indicated for maintenance of cardiovascular function following paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites
   - 6-8 g IV for every 1000 mL of ascitic fluid removed
Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome:
   - Indicated for adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in conjunction with diuretics to correct fluid volume overload associated with ARDS
   - 25 g IV over 30 minutes; repeat q8hr PRN
Burns:
   - Indicated after 24 hr post burn if severe albumin depletion in order to favor edema reabsorption
   - Amount of albumin required to achieve adequate plasma volume and protein content should be determined by direct observation of vital signs or measurement of either plasma oncotic pressure or protein content
Cardiopulmonary Bypass:
   - Indicated for procedures as part of the priming fluids for bypass machine
   - Required dose can be estimated from the difference between the desired and actual total serum protein concentration multiplied by the estimated plasma volume (~40 mL/kg) times 2 (to account for extravascular deficit, which absorbs about half of the administered dose)
Hypoalbuminemia:
   - Indicated for restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume deficiency caused by illness or active bleeding; when albumin deficiency results from excessive protein loss, the effect of albumin administration will be temporary unless the underlying disorder is reversed
Hemodialysis:
   - Indicated for patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis or for those who are fluid-overloaded and cannot tolerate substantial volumes of sodium for therapy of shock or hypotension
   - 25 g IV
Hypovolemia:
   - Indicated for restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume where volume deficiency is demonstrated and colloid use is appropriate
   - Initial 25 g IV; adjust according to volume requirements
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome:
   - Indicated as a plasma expander in fluid management of severe forms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)
   - 50-100 g IV infused over 4 hr; repeat q4-12hr PRN

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn:
   - 25% albumin: 1 g/kg/dose IV administered before or during plasma exchange  
   - Use 25% concentration with extreme caution in neonates, owing to risk of intraventricular hemorrhage from rapid expansion of intravascular volume
Hypovolemia:
   - 5% albumin: 0.5-1 g/kg/dose IV infused over 1 hr; may infuse more rapidly for hypovolemic shock
Ascites with Hypoalbuminemia:
   - 25% albumin: 1 g/kg/dose IV infused over 2-3 hr; may repeat q8hr until serum albumin above 2.5 g/dL</rdf:hasDose></rdf:Description>

   - Alternatively, if the patient has been intubated, epinephrine can be injected via the endotracheal tube directly into the bronchial tree at the same dosage as for IV injection
   - 2-2.5 mg q3-5min until IV/IO access established or spontaneous circulation restored 
Hypotension Associated with Septic Shock:
   - Indicated to increase mean arterial blood pressure in adults with hypotension associated with septic shock 
   - Recommended dose: 0.05-2 mcg/kg/minute IV infusion; titrate to desired mean arterial pressure (MAP); may adjust dose q10-15 min by 0.05-0.2 mcg/kg/minute to achieve desired blood pressure goal

   - See also Administration
Anaphylaxis:
   - Indicated in emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis
  0.1 mg/mL solution:
   - 0.1 mg IV at rate of 1-4 mcg/min over 5 min to prevent the need to repeat injections frequently OR may initiate with infusion at 5-15 mcg/min (with crystalloid administration); IV administration should only be done in patients who are profoundly hypotensive or are in cardiopulmonary arrest refractory to volume resuscitation and several epinephrine injections
  1 mg/mL solution:
   - 0.3-0.5 mg (0.3-0.5 mL) of undiluted epinephrine IM/SC once in anterolateral aspect of the thigh, not to exceed 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per injection, repeated every 5-10 minutes as necessary

Pediatric Dosing Information:
CMV Prevention in Kidney &amp; Heart Transplant :
  Kidney transplantation:
   - &lt;4 months: Safety and efficacy not established
   - 4 months to 16 years: Daily dose (mg) = 7 x BSA x CrCl; not to exceed 900 mg/day
   - Begin within 10 days of transplant and continue until 200 days post-transplant
  Heart transplantation :
   - &lt;1 month: Safety and efficacy not established
   - 1 month to 16 years: Daily dose (mg) = 7 x BSA x CrCl; not to exceed 900 mg/day
   - Begin within 10 days of transplant and continue until 100 days post-transplant
Dosing Considerations:
   - Calculation of creatinine clearance for the dose in children is by a modified Schwartz formula
   - The oral solution is the preferred formulation for children since it provides the ability to administer a dose calculated according to the Schwartz formula
   - Tablets may be used if the calculated doses are within 10% of available tablet strength (450 mg)
   - For example, if the calculated dose is between 405 mg and 495 mg, one 450 mg tablet may be taken
   - Assess children for the ability to swallow tablets
  Calculate BSA by Mosteller equation:
   - BSA (m²) = height (cm) X weight (kg) divided by 3600  
  Calculate CrCl by Schwartz equation:
   - CrCl (mL/min/1.73 m²) = K x height (cm) divided by serum Cr (mg/dL)
   - If CrCl exceeds 150 mL/min/1.73 m², then use maximum value of 150 mL/min/1.73 m²; an upper limit of 150 mL/min/1.73 m² helps prevent the potential for over dosing
   - If the calculated pediatric dose exceeds 900 mg, a dose of 900 mg should be given to the child
   - Where K =  0.33 for infants aged &lt;1 yr with low birth weight for gestational age 0.45 for infants aged &lt;1 yr with birth weight appropriate for gestational age 0.45 for aged 4 months to &lt;1-2 yr 0.55 for boys aged 2 to &lt;13 yr and girls aged 2 to &lt;16 yr 0.7 for boys aged 13-16 yr

   - If a patient plans to miss scheduled Cabenuva (cabotegravir; rilpivirine) extended-release injectable suspensions by &gt;7 days, take daily PO therapy to replace up to 2 consecutive monthly or 1 scheduled every-2-month injection visit(s) 
   - 25 mg PO qDay plus cabotegravir 30 mg PO qDay as replacement for up to 2 consecutive months
   - Take first dose of oral therapy at approximately the same time as the planned missed injection and continue until the day injection dosing restarted 
Dosage Modifications:
  Renal impairment:
   - Mild-to-moderate renal impairment: No dose adjustment required
   - Severe renal impairment or ESRD: Used with caution and with increased monitoring for adverse effects, plasma concentrations may be increased because of altered drug absorption, distribution, and metabolism secondary to renal dysfunction
   - Dialysis: Highly bound to plasma proteins, unlikely to be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Classes A and B): No dose adjustment required
   - Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C): Has not been studied

Pediatric Dosing Information:
HIV-1 Infection:
   - Indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adolescents aged ≥2 years with HIV-1 RNA ≤100,000 copies/mL

  Acute symptoms:
   - 160-325 mg PO; chew nonenteric-coated tablet upon presentation (within minutes of symptoms)
   - If unable to take PO, may give 300-600 mg suppository PR
  Maintenance (secondary prevention):
   - 81-325 mg PO qDay indefinitely (preferred dose); may give 81-325 mg/day
   - Regimen may depend on coadministered drugs or comorbid conditions
   - Extended-release capsule (Durlaza [Rx]): 162.5 mg PO qDay
  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty:
   - Adjunctive aspirin therapy to support reperfusion with primary PCI (with or without fibrinolytic therapy)

   - Coadministered with ticagrelor: 81 mg PO qDay
Primary ASCVD Prevention with Low-Dose Aspirin:
   - Adults aged 40-70 years: Consider use of low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg PO qDay) for select adults who are at higher risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but not at increased bleeding risk (AHA/ACC 2019 Guidelines on Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease)
   - Adults aged &gt;70 years: Low-dose aspirin should not be administered on a routine basis for primary prevention of ASCVD
   - Any age with increased bleeding risk: Do not administer low-dose aspirin for primary prevention
   - Note: There may be select circumstances where clinicians might discuss prophylactic aspirin with adults aged &lt;40 yr or &gt;70 yr in the context of other known ASCVD risk factors (eg, strong family history of premature MI, inability to achieve lipid or BP or glucose targets, or significant elevation in coronary artery calcium score)
Ischemic Stroke &amp; Transient Ischemic Attack:
   - Initial: 160-325 mg PO within 48 hr of stroke/TIA onset, followed by 75-100 mg PO qDay

  Maintenance (secondary prevention):
   - Extended-release capsule (Durlaza [Rx]): 162.5 mg PO qDay
Anti-Inflammatory:
   - Use of non-aspirin NSAIDs has largely supplanted the use of aspirin for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory arthritides
   - Immediate release: Usual maintenance dose: 2.1-7.3 g/day in divided doses (individualize dose); monitor serum salicylate concentrations
Colorectal Cancer (Off-label):

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Acute Coronary Syndrome:
   - Unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI): 300 mg loading dose; initiating therapy without a loading dose will delay establishment of antiplatelet effect by several days; following the loading dose, administer 75 mg/day PO for up to 12 months; may administer beyond 12 months if used in combination with aspirin (75-100 mg/day); long-term combination therapy with aspirin, following stent placement, is individualized depending on how a patient tolerates long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), whether they have stable coronary artery disease, and do NOT have risk factors (eg, TIA or stroke, age &gt;75 years, bleeding risk, low body wt, concurrent medications)
   - ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI): 75 mg/day PO in combination with aspirin 162-325 mg/day and then 81-162 mg/day
  &lt;75 years:
   - 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg for 14 days up to 12 months (if no bleeding)
   - Concomitant therapy with aspirin: Administer in combination with aspirin 75-325 mg qDay with or without thrombolytics
  &gt;75 years:
   - No loading dose
   - 75 mg for 14 days up to 12 months (if no bleeding)
Recent MI, Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease:
   - 75 mg PO qDay without a loading dose; recommended as alternative to aspirin or concomitantly with aspirin if patient not at increased risk for bleeding but at high risk for cardiovascular disease 
Coronary Artery Disease:
   - 75 mg PO qDay
Cardioembolic Stroke:
   - Prophylaxis if patient not candidate for oral anticoagulation
   - 75 mg/day PO
Carotid Artery Stenting (Off-label):
   - 300 mg PO plus aspirin 81-325 mg for 1 dose on day before carotid artery stenting (CAS), then 75 mg/day PO plus aspirin 81-325 mg/day for at least 30 days after CAS 
   - Alternative: 300-600 mg PO once, then 75 mg/day for 4 days before CAS in combination with aspirin 81-325 mg/day
Dosage Modifications:
   - Renal impairment: Dose adjustment not necessary
   - Hepatic impairment: Use caution; experience limited
Dosing Considerations:
   - CYP2C19 poor metabolizers associated with diminished antiplatelet response to clopidogrel; although higher-dose regimen (600 mg loading dose followed by 150 mg once daily) in poor metabolizers increases antiplatelet response, no appropriate dosing regimen for poor metabolizers has been established in clinical outcome trials

Cough:
   - 5 mg/1.5 mg (1 tablet) PO q4-6hr
   - Not to exceed 30 mg/9 mg (6 tablets) in 24 hr
Dosing considerations:
   - Advise patients not to increase dose or dosing frequency; serious adverse events such as respiratory depression may occur with overdosage; the dosage should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated for possible underlying pathology
   - Prescribe for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals
   - Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy [
   - Reevaluate patients with unresponsive cough in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease
   - If a patient requires a refill, reevaluate cause of cough and assess need for continued treatment; the relative incidence of adverse reactions, and development of addiction, abuse, or misuse
   - Do not abruptly discontinue in a physically-dependent patient; when a patient who has been taking drug regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy, taper dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal
   - If patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise dose to previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing interval between decreases, decreasing amount of change in dose, or both
Limitations of use:
   - Because of risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses reserve medication for use in adult patients for whom benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of etiology of cough has been made

Rheumatoid Arthritis:
   - Indicated for treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis
   - 400-600 mg/day (310-465 mg base/day) PO as a qDay or in BID
   - When a good response is obtained, reduce dosage by 50% and continue maintenance dose of 200-400 mg/day (155-310 mg base/day) PO as a qDay or in BID; not exceed 600 mg or 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) per day, whichever is lower, as the incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is exceeded
   - Use corticosteroids and salicylates in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine; gradually decrease dosage or eliminate after a maintenance dose has been achieved
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus:
   - Indicated for treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus
   - 200-400 mg/day (155-310 mg base/day) PO as a single daily dose or in two divided doses

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Off-label):
   - FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine on June 15, 2020 
   - Based on its ongoing analysis of the EUA and emerging scientific data, the FDA determined that hydroxychloroquine is unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA; additionally, in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the EUA
   - While additional clinical trials may continue to evaluate potential benefit, the FDA determined the EUA was no longer appropriate
   - The NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines recommend against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and in nonhospitalized patients 
   - For more information, see the FDA news release: FDA Revokes Emergency Use Authorization for Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine

Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (Off-label):
   - 100-200 mg (77.5-155 mg base) PO 2-3 times/wk
   - Dosing Considerations
   - A reduction in dosage may be necessary for patients with hepatic or renal disease
   - Before prescribing hydroxychloroquine for treatment or prophylaxis of malaria, consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Malaria website (link https://www.cdc.gov/malaria)
  Limitations of use in malaria:
   - Not recommended for treatment of complicated malaria
   - Not effective against chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species
   - Not recommended for treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified
   - Not recommended for malaria prophylaxis in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs
   - Does not prevent relapses of P vivax or P ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite forms of these parasites 
   - For radical cure of P vivax and P ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Malaria:
  Prophylaxis:
   - Indicated for prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported.
   - 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) PO once weekly, not to exceed 400 mg (310 mg base), starting 2 weeks before exposure and continued for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area  
  Acute treatment:
   - Indicated for treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to P falciparum, P malariae, P ovale, and P vivax
   - 13 mg/kg (10 mg/kg base), not to exceed 800 mg (620 mg base) followed by 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base), not to exceed 400 mg (310 mg base), PO at 6 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr after initial dose  
Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (Off-label):
   - Dosing schedules not well established in children
   - A case report describes 3 mg/kg PO twice weekly over 14 months reported as safe and effective in a child aged 4 yr
Dosing Considerations:
   - The Sovuna dosage form cannot be directly administered to pediatric patients weighing &lt; 23 kg because lowest possible dose of 150 mg (half of the scored 300 mg tablet) exceeds recommended dose for these patients 
   - Before to prescribing hydroxychloroquine for treatment or prophylaxis of malaria, consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Malaria website (link https://www.cdc.gov/malaria)

Anemia Associated with Chronic Kidney Disease:
   - Indicated for treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults on dialysis or not on dialysis 
   - Individualize dose and use lowest dose sufficient to reduce need for RBC transfusions 
   - Administer IV or SC 
  All adults with CKD:
   - Do not increase dose more frequently than q4weeks; decreases in dose can occur more frequently; avoid frequent dose adjustments
   - If hemoglobin rises rapidly (eg, &gt;1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce dose by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses
   - After 4 weeks: Increase dose by 25% for patients who do not respond adequately (ie, hemoglobin [Hgb] has not increased by &gt;1 g/dL) 
   - After 12 weeks dose escalation: If inadequate response, increasing dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks
   - Use lowest dose that will maintain Hgb level sufficient to reduce need for RBC transfusions
   - Evaluate other causes of anemia
   - Discontinue if responsiveness does not improve
  Adults on dialysis:
   - Initiate when Hgb level &lt; 10 g/dL
   - If Hgb ≥11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt dose
   - Dose if not currently on ESA therapy: 0.6 mcg/kg IV/SC q2week initially  
   - Once hemoglobin has been stabilized, administer dose once monthly using a dose that is twice that of every-two-week dose and subsequently titrated as necessary
  Adults not on dialysis:
   -  Consider initiating only when Hgb &lt;10 g/dL and the following considerations apply  Rate of Hgb decline indicates likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and reducing risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal  
   - Rate of Hgb decline indicates likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and reducing risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal
   - If Hgb &gt;10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt dose, and use lowest dose sufficient to reduce need for RBC transfusions
   - Dose if not currently on ESA therapy: 1.2 mcg/kg IV/SC qMonth initially; alternantely, 0.6 mcg/kg IV/SC q2week  
   - Once Hgb stabilized, administer dose once monthly using a dose that is twice that of the every-two-week dose and subsequently titrated as necessary

Thrombocytopenia :
   - Indicated as an anticoagulant for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
   - Initial: 2 mcg/kg/min IV continuous infusion over 1-3 hours until steady-state aPTT is 1.5-3 times initial baseline value  
   - Not to exceed infusion rate of 10 mcg/kg/min
  Dosing considerations:
   - Check aPTT and adjust dose until target aPTT is achieved
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention:
   - Indicated as an anticoagulant in patients with or at risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
   - Initial: 25 mcg/kg/min IV infusion, AND  
   - A bolus of 350 mcg/kg IV over 3-5 minutes via large-bore IV line
   - Check activated clotting time (ACT) 5-10 minutes after bolus dose is completed; procedure may proceed if ACT is &gt;300 seconds
   - If ACT is &lt;300 seconds, administer additional IV bolus dose of 150 mcg/kg, increase infusion dose to 30 mcg/kg/min, and check ACT 5-10 minutes later
   - If ACT &gt;450 seconds, decrease infusion rate to 15 mcg/kg/min, and check ACT 5-10 minutes later
   - After therapeutic ACT (300-450 sec) achieved, continue this infusion dose for duration of procedure
Dosing Modifications:
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Approximately 4-fold decrease in clearance relative to those with normal hepatic function, so dosing modification warranted; monitor aPTT and adjust dosage as clinically indicated
   - Thrombocytopenia: Decrease initial dose to 0.5 mcg/kg/min IV  
   - PCI: For patients with hepatic impairment undergoing PCI and who have HIT or are at risk for HIT, carefully titrate argatroban until desired level of anticoagulation achieved; use of drug in PCI patients with clinically significant hepatic disease or AST/ALT levels ≥3 times the upper limit of normal should be avoided

   - CYP2C9 *2/*3: 0.5-2 mg
   - CYP2C9 *3/*3: 0.5-2 mg
Dosage Modifications:
   - Hepatic impairment: May potentiate warfarin response because of decreased metabolism and impaired synthesis of clotting factors
Dosing Considerations:
   - Indication determines intensity and duration of therapy
   - Individualized doses and monitoring of PT/INR are necessary
   - Monitoring frequency should be daily or once every few days until stabilized; once stable, q4-6 weeks or longer may be appropriate (eg, 12 weeks)
   - Not all factors causing warfarin dose variability are known, but they include age, race, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, and comorbidities, in addition to genetic factors
   - Lower starting doses (ie, 2-5 mg/day × 2 days) recommended with the elderly, hepatic impairment, poor nutrition, CHF, high bleeding risk, debilitated patients, heart valve replacement, concomitant medications known to increase warfarin effect, or individuals suspected of having genomic variants
   - Perioperative management recommendations: Hold warfarin therapy approximately 5 days before surgery; resume warfarin 12-24 hr after surgery; bridge anticoagulation during interruption in patients at high thromboembolism risk
   - Minor procedures and dental procedures: See ACCP guidelines for specific recommendations
   - Warfarin has no direct effect on an established thrombus, nor does it reverse ischemic tissue damage
   - Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli; some cases have progressed to necrosis or death; discontinue therapy if such emboli occur
   - Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves: Therapy may cause fetal harm; however, benefits may outweigh the risks

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Thrombosis:
   - Prevention/treatment: If baseline INR is 1.0-1.3, administer loading dose of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg PO qDay × 1 day; check INR on days 2-4 and adjust daily dose to maintain INR between 2.0 and 3.0 (unless valve replacement indicates a higher range)  
   - Use 0.1 mg/kg to initiate therapy with liver impairment or in patients who have had a Fontan procedure
   - Typical maintenance dose: 0.09-0.33 mg/kg/day, with infants &lt;12 months old often requiring doses at high end of range
  Dosing considerations:
   - Consistent anticoagulation in children is difficult and requires close supervision and frequent dose adjustments
   - Refer to ACCP recommendations or institutional protocol for treatment duration dependent on indication
   - Infants and children receiving vitamin K-supplemented nutrition (including infant formulas): May be resistant to warfarin therapy
   - Infants with human-milk diet: May be sensitive to warfarin therapy
Dosing Considerations:
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Hepatic impairment may potentiate warfarin response because of decreased metabolism and impaired synthesis of clotting factors
   - Load: 0.1 mg/kg PO qDay × 2 days
   - Typical maintenance dose: 0.1 mg/kg PO qDay; adjust dose to achieve desired INR
   - Common maintenance dose range: 0.05-0.34 mg/kg PO qDay</rdf:hasDose></rdf:Description>

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP):
   - Indicated for thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment
   - Initial dose: 100 mg PO BID
   - After a month, if platelet count has not increased to at least 50 x 10^9/L, increase dose to 150 mg PO BID
   - Use the lowest dose to achieve and maintain a platelet count at least 50 x 10^9/L as necessary to reduce the risk of bleeding
Dosage Modifications:
  Adverse reaction dose reduction schedule:
   - Example, if a patient is on the maximum dose at the time of an adverse reaction, the first dose reduction would be from 300 mg/day to 200 mg/day
   - 300 mg/day: (150-mg tablet AM and PM)

   - Hypertensive crisis (systolic [&gt;180 mmHg] and/or diastolic [&gt;120 mmHg]) Interrupt or discontinue fostamatinib Initiate or increase dosage of antihypertensive medication; adjust as needed until BP is controlled If BP returns to less than the target BP, resume at same daily dose If repeat BP is ≥160/100 mmHg for &gt;4 weeks despite aggressive antihypertensive treatment, discontinue fostamatinib 
   - Interrupt or discontinue fostamatinib
   - Initiate or increase dosage of antihypertensive medication; adjust as needed until BP is controlled
   - If BP returns to less than the target BP, resume at same daily dose
   - If repeat BP is ≥160/100 mmHg for &gt;4 weeks despite aggressive antihypertensive treatment, discontinue fostamatinib
  Hepatoxicity:
   - AST/ALT (≥3x to &lt;5x upper limit of normal [ULN]) Symptomatic: Interrupt fostamatinib; recheck liver function tests (LFTs) q72hr until ALT/AST are below 1.5x ULN and total bilirubin (BL) remains &lt;2x ULN; resume at next lower daily dose Asymptomatic: Recheck LFTs q72hr until ALT/AST are &lt;1.5x ULN and total BL remains &lt;2x ULN; consider interrupting or reducing dose if ALT/AST and total BL remain at AST/ALT 3-5x ULN and total BL remains &lt;2x ULN; if interrupted, resume at next lower daily dose; when ALT/AST are no longer elevated (&lt;1.5x ULN) and total BL remains &lt;2x ULN 
   - Symptomatic: Interrupt fostamatinib; recheck liver function tests (LFTs) q72hr until ALT/AST are below 1.5x ULN and total bilirubin (BL) remains &lt;2x ULN; resume at next lower daily dose
   - Asymptomatic: Recheck LFTs q72hr until ALT/AST are &lt;1.5x ULN and total BL remains &lt;2x ULN; consider interrupting or reducing dose if ALT/AST and total BL remain at AST/ALT 3-5x ULN and total BL remains &lt;2x ULN; if interrupted, resume at next lower daily dose; when ALT/AST are no longer elevated (&lt;1.5x ULN) and total BL remains &lt;2x ULN
   - AST/ALT (≥5x ULN) and total BL (&lt;2x ULN) Interrupt fostamatinib Recheck LFTs q72hr: If AST/ALT decrease, recheck until ALT/AST are no longer elevated (&lt;1.5x ULN) and total BL remains &lt;2x ULN; resume at next lower daily dose If AST/ALT persist at ≥5x ULN for ≥2 weeks, discontinue fostamatinib 
   - Interrupt fostamatinib
   - Recheck LFTs q72hr: If AST/ALT decrease, recheck until ALT/AST are no longer elevated (&lt;1.5x ULN) and total BL remains &lt;2x ULN; resume at next lower daily dose
   - If AST/ALT persist at ≥5x ULN for ≥2 weeks, discontinue fostamatinib
   - AST/ALT (≥3x ULN) and total BL (&gt;2x ULN) Discontinue fostamatinib 
   - Discontinue fostamatinib
   - Elevated unconjugated (indirect) BL in absence of other LFT abnormalities Continue fostamatinib; monitor frequently since isolated increase in unconjugated (indirect) BL may be due to UGT1A1 inhibition 
   - Continue fostamatinib; monitor frequently since isolated increase in unconjugated (indirect) BL may be due to UGT1A1 inhibition
  Diarrhea:
   - Use supportive measures (eg, dietary changes, hydration, and/or antidiarrheal medication) early after the onset until symptoms have resolved
   - If symptoms become severe (≥Grade 3), temporarily interrupt fostamatinib
   - If diarrhea improves to mild (Grade 1), resume at the next lower daily dose
  Neutropenia:
   - ANC (&lt;1 x 10^9/L) and remains low after 72 hr: Temporarily interrupt fostamatinib until resolved (ANC &gt;1.5 x 10^9/L); resume at the next lower daily dose thereafter
  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor:
   - Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases exposure to the major active metabolite (R406); monitor for toxicities that may require fostamatinib dose reduction
Dosing Considerations:
  Monitor:
   - Obtain baseline assessments
   - Monitor CBC counts monthly until a stable platelet count (at least 50 x 10^9/L) is achieved; continue monitoring CBC counts regularly thereafter
   - Monitor LFTs monthly
   - Monitor blood pressure q2Weeks until establishment of a stable dose, then monthly thereafter
  Discontinuation:
   - Discontinue after 12 weeks of treatment if platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding

   - Infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment
Sexually Transmitted Disease:
   - Prevention following sexual assault
   - 2 g PO as a single dose; 3-drug regimen that also includes ceftriaxone or cefixime, PLUS azithromycin or doxycycline (CDC STD guidelines, 2010)
Bacterial Vaginosis:
  Nonpregnant women:
   - 500 mg PO BID x 7 days, OR
   - 2 g PO qDay single dose, OR
   - Extended-release: 750 mg PO qDay x 7 days
  Pregnant women:
   - 500 mg PO BID x 7 days, OR
   - 250 mg PO TID x 7 days
Colorectal Surgical Infection:
   - Prophylaxis; start after mechanical bowel preparation the afternoon and evening before surgery
   - 1 g PO q6-8hr for 3 doses
   - 15 mg/kg IV over 30-60 min; complete approximately 1 hr before surgery; may administer 7.5 mg/kg IV over 30-60 min at 6 and 12 hr after initial dose for maintenance; discontinue within 12 hr after surgery
Trichomoniasis:
   - 250 mg PO q8hr for 7 days
   - 2 g PO qDay single dose; alternatively, 1g PO q12hr for 2 doses
  Individualize dosage regimen:
   - Single-dose treatment may help improve compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who may be nonadherent to a seven-day regimen
   - Seven-day treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting patient long enough for sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment; some data suggest cure rates may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen;
   - If a repeat course of therapy is required, a 4- to 6-weeks need to elapse between courses and reconfirmed presence of the trichomonad; monitor total and differential leukocyte counts before and after re-treatment
Amebiasis:
   - Acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg PO TID 5-10 days
   - Amebic liver abscess: 500-750 mg PO TID for 5-10 days

Dosage Modifications:
  Renal impairment:
   - Mild-to-moderate: Dose adjustment not considered necessary as elimination half-life not significantly altered
   - Severe or end-stage renal disease: Metronidazole and metronidazole metabolites may accumulate significantly because of reduced urinary excretion; monitor patients not undergoing hemodialysis
   - Hemodialysis removes significant amounts of metronidazole and its metabolites from systemic circulation; supplementation may be necessary
   - Peritoneal dialysis: Monitor for signs of toxicity due to potential accumulation of metronidazole metabolites
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Mild-to- moderate (Child-Pugh A or B): No dosage adjustment necessary; monitor
   - Severe (Child-Pugh C): Reduce dose of by 50%
Dosing Considerations:
  Hepatic failure:
   - Mild to moderate hapatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B): No dosage adjustment needed but patients should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events
   - Severe hepatic impairment: Reduce dose of by 50%
  Renal failure:
   - Mild to moderate renal impairment: Dose adjustment not considered necessary as elimination half-life not significantly altered
   - Severe renal impairment or end stage of renal disease: Metronidazole and metronidazole metabolites may accumulate significantly because of reduced urinary excretion; monitor in severe renal impairment or end stage of renal disease, not undergoing hemodialysis
   - Hemodialysis removes significant amounts of metronidazole and its metabolites from systemic circulation; supplementation may be necessary
   - Peritoneal dialysis: Monitor for signs of toxicity due to potential accumulation of metronidazole metabolites
Dosing Considerations:
   - To reduce developing drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of antibacterial drugs, use metronidazole only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria
   - When culture and susceptibility information are available, consider selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy
   - In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may help in selecting an empiric therapy

  AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines for atrial fibrillation:
   - Class 1: For patients with AF or atrial flutter &lt;48-hour duration and with high risk of stroke, IV heparin or LMWH, or administration of a factor Xa or direct thrombin inhibitor, is recommended as soon as possible before or immediately after cardioversion, followed by long-term anticoagulation therapy
   - Class IIa: For patients with AF or atrial flutter of ≥48-hr, or when the duration of AF is unknown, anticoagulation with warfarin (INR 2-3), a factor Xa inhibitor, or direct thrombin inhibitor is recommended for at least 3 weeks prior to and 4 weeks after cardioversion
   - Class IIb: For patients with AF or atrial flutter &lt;48-hour duration who are at low thromboembolic risk, anticoagulation (IV heparin, LMWH, or a new oral anticoagulant) or no antithrombotic therapy may be considered for cardioversion, without the need for postcardioversion oral anticoagulation
   - For patients with nonvalvular AF unable to maintain a therapeutic INR level with warfarin, use of a direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor
   - Not recommended in patients with AF and end-stage CKD or on hemodialysis because of the lack of evidence from clinical trials regarding the balance of risks and benefits; warfarin or apixaban recommended 
   - Circulation July 9, 2019
DVT or PE Treatment:
   - Indicated for treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE) in patients who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5-10 days

   - If dabigatran is not started on the day of surgery, after hemostasis has been achieved initiate treatment with 220 mg qDay
   - CrCl ≤30 mL/min or on dialysis: Dosing recommendations cannot be provided
   - CrCl &lt;50 mL/min with concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors: Avoid coadministration
Dosing Considerations:
  Different dosage forms:
   - Available in different dosage forms (ie, capsules for adults or children aged 8 to &lt;18 years, oral pellets for children aged 3 months to &lt;12 years) and not all dosage forms are approved for the same indications and age groups
   - Additionally, there are differences between dosage forms with respect to dosing owing different bioavailability
   - Do not substitute different dosage forms (for example, capsules) for oral pellets on a milligram-to-milligram basis and do not combine more than 1 dosage form to achieve the total dose 
  Converting to dabigatran from warfarin or parenteral anticoagulants:
   - Converting from warfarin: Discontinue warfarin and initiate dabigatran when INR &lt;2.0
   - Converting from parenteral anticoagulant: Give dabigatran 0-2 hours before time for next dose of the parenteral drug that was to have been administered or initiate at time of discontinuing continuous IV heparin
  Converting from dabigatran to warfarin or parenteral anticoagulants:
   - CrCl ≥50 mL/min: Start warfarin 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran
   - CrCl 30-50 mL/min: Start warfarin 2 days before discontinuing dabigatran
   - CrCl 15-30 mL/min: Start warfarin 1 day before discontinuing dabigatran
   - CrCl &lt;15 mL/min: No recommendations can be made
   - Converting to parenteral anticoagulant: Wait 12 hours (CrCl ≥30 mL/min) or 24 hours (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min) after last dabigatran dose before initiating parenteral anticoagulant
  Discontinuation for surgery and other interventions:
   - If possible, discontinue dabigatran 1 to 2 days (CrCl ≥50 mL/min) or 3 to 5 days (CrCl &lt;50 mL/min) before invasive or surgical procedures because of the increased risk of bleeding
   - Consider longer times for patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or placement of a spinal or epidural catheter or port, in whom complete hemostasis may be required
   - If surgery cannot be delayed, there is increased risk of bleeding; this risk of bleeding should be weighed against urgency of intervention; use a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) in case of emergency surgery or urgent procedures when reversal of anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed; refer to idarucizumab prescribing information for additional information
   - Restart dabigatran capsules as soon as medically appropriate

Factor X Deficiency:
  Indicated in adults and children with hereditary Factor X deficiency for :
   - Routine prophylaxis to reduce frequency of bleeding episodes, 
   - On-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes, and 
   - Perioperative management of bleeding with mild, moderate, or severe hereditary Factor X deficiency
  General dose information :
   - Dose and duration depend on the severity of the factor X deficiency, location and extent of the bleeding, and the patient’s clinical condition
   - Base the dose and frequency on the individual clinical response
   - Do not administer &gt;60 IU/kg daily
   - Each vial is labeled with the actual factor X potency/content in International Units (IU)
  Estimate in vivo peak increase in factor X:
   - Estimate the expected in vivo peak increase in Factor X level expressed as IU/dL (or % of normal) using the following:
   - Estimated Increment of Factor X (IU/dL or % of normal) = [Total Dose (IU)/Body Weight (kg)] x 2
  Calculate desired in vivo peak increase in factor X:
   - The dose to achieve a desired in vivo peak increase in factor X level may be calculated using the following formula:
   - Dose (IU) = Body Weight (kg) x Desired Factor X Rise (IU/dL) x 0.5
   - Note: The desired factor X rise is the difference between the patient’s plasma factor X level and the desired level
   - The dosing formula is based on the observed recovery of 2 IU/dL per IU/kg
  On-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes:
   - Infuse 25 IU/kg when the first sign of bleeding occurs
   - Repeat at intervals of 24 hr until the bleeding stops
  Perioperative management of bleeding:
   - Measure postinfusion plasma factor X levels for each patient before and after surgery to ensure that hemostatic levels are obtained and maintained
   - Presurgery: Calculate the dose to raise plasma factor X levels to 70-90 IU/dL using the following formula: Required dose (IU) = Body Weight (kg) x Desired Factor X Rise (IU/dL) x 0.5
   - Postsurgery: Repeat dose as necessary to maintain plasma factor X levels at a minimum of 50 IU/dL until the patient is no longer at risk of bleeding
  Prophylaxis of bleeding episodes:
   - 25 mg IV twice weekly
   - Owing to inter-and intra-patient variability, it is recommended that trough blood levels of FX should be monitored at intervals, especially in the first weeks of therapy or after dosages changes
   - Adjust dosage regimen to clinical response and trough levels of FX of at least 5 IU/dL
   - Not to exceed peak level of 120 IU/dL
Dosing Considerations:
   - Perioperative management of bleeding in major surgery in patients with moderate and severe hereditary factor X deficiency has not been studied

   - Indicated for emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose induced by natural or synthetic opioids in adults and pediatric patients aged ≥12 years, as manifested by respiratory and/or CNS depression 
   - Intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present 
   - Initial dose: 1.5 mg IM or SC into anterolateral aspect of the thigh, through clothing if necessary 
   -  Repeat dosing   Seek emergency medical assistance as soon as possible after first dose  Requirement for repeat doses depends upon amount, type, and route of administration of the opioid being antagonized  If patient responds and subsequently relapses back into respiratory depression before emergency assistance arrives, administer an additional dose using a new autoinjector and continue monitoring  If desired response not obtained after 2-5 minutes, administer additional dose using a new autoinjector; if there is still no response and additional doses are available, administer additional doses q2-5 minutes using new autoinjector for each dose until emergency medical assistance arrives  Additional supportive and/or resuscitative measures may be helpful while awaiting emergency medical assistance  Partial agonists or mixed agonist/antagonists (eg, buprenorphine): Reversal of respiratory depression may be incomplete and require repeated administration of using a new autoinjector   
   - Seek emergency medical assistance as soon as possible after first dose 
   - Requirement for repeat doses depends upon amount, type, and route of administration of the opioid being antagonized 
   - If patient responds and subsequently relapses back into respiratory depression before emergency assistance arrives, administer an additional dose using a new autoinjector and continue monitoring 
   - If desired response not obtained after 2-5 minutes, administer additional dose using a new autoinjector; if there is still no response and additional doses are available, administer additional doses q2-5 minutes using new autoinjector for each dose until emergency medical assistance arrives 
   - Additional supportive and/or resuscitative measures may be helpful while awaiting emergency medical assistance 
   - Partial agonists or mixed agonist/antagonists (eg, buprenorphine): Reversal of respiratory depression may be incomplete and require repeated administration of using a new autoinjector 
  1 mg/mL (vial):
   - Indicated for management of known or suspected opioid overdose
   - Also, indicated for complete or partial reversal of opioid drug effects, including respiratory depression, induced by either natural or synthetic opioids
   -  Initial dose  May administer IV (preferred), IM, or SC Non-opioid dependent patients: 0.5 mg/70 kg; may administer a second dose of 1 mg/70 kg 2-5 minutes later if necessary Suspected opioid dependency: Administer a challenge dose of 0.1 mg/70 kg initially; if no evidence of withdrawal within 2 minutes, the recommended dosing should be followed If no clinical response after administering a total dose of 1.5 mg/70 kg, additional nalmefene is unlikely to have an effect Do not give more nalmefene than is required to restore respiratory rate to normal, thus minimizing the likelihood of cardiovascular stress and precipitated withdrawal syndrome If respiratory depression recurs, titrate dose again to clinical effect using incremental doses to avoid over-reversal   
   - May administer IV (preferred), IM, or SC
   - Non-opioid dependent patients: 0.5 mg/70 kg; may administer a second dose of 1 mg/70 kg 2-5 minutes later if necessary
   - Suspected opioid dependency: Administer a challenge dose of 0.1 mg/70 kg initially; if no evidence of withdrawal within 2 minutes, the recommended dosing should be followed
   - If no clinical response after administering a total dose of 1.5 mg/70 kg, additional nalmefene is unlikely to have an effect
   - Do not give more nalmefene than is required to restore respiratory rate to normal, thus minimizing the likelihood of cardiovascular stress and precipitated withdrawal syndrome
   - If respiratory depression recurs, titrate dose again to clinical effect using incremental doses to avoid over-reversal 
   -  Loss of IV access   Single IM or SC 1-mg doses have been shown to effective within 5-15 min of administration  
   - Single IM or SC 1-mg doses have been shown to effective within 5-15 min of administration
Dosage Modifications:
  Renal impairment:
   - Renal failure substantially reduces clearance of nalmefene; for single episodes of opioid antagonism, deliver incremental doses slowly (over 60 seconds) to minimize hypertension and dizziness following abrupt administration
  Hepatic impairment:
   - All severities: Hepatic disease substantially reduces clearance; for single episodes of opioid antagonism, no dosage adjustment necessary
Dosing Considerations:
   - Nalmefene had no effect in cases where opioids were not responsible for sedation and hypoventilation
   - Only treat when likelihood of an opioid overdose is high, based on a history of opioid overdose or clinical presentation of respiratory depression with concurrent pupillary constriction
  Patients tolerant to or physically dependent opioids:
   - May cause acute withdrawal symptoms in individuals who have some degree of tolerance to and dependence on opioids
   - Closely observe for symptoms of withdrawal following administration 
   - Administer subsequent doses with intervals of at least 2-5 minutes between doses to allow the full effect of each incremental dose of nalmefene to be reached

Multiple Sclerosis:
   - Indicated as monotherapy for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease
   - 300 mg IV infusion q4wk
   - When initiating and continuing treatment, consider whether expected benefit is sufficient to offset risk of PML
Crohn Disease:
   - Indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn disease in adults who had inadequate/intolerant response to conventional treatment and TNF-alpha inhibitors
   - 300 mg IV q4wk
Dosing Considerations:
   - Because natalizumab increases risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), it is recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate multiple sclerosis therapy
   - Additional or previous immunosuppressive therapy increases risk for PML; therefore, do not administer concomitantly with immunosuppressants (eg, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, or methotrexate) or TNF-alpha inhibitors

   - Dosages above 400 mg/day have not been studied
   - If treatment is to be discontinued, gradually reduce dose over a period of 1-2 weeks
Acute Tachyarrhythmia (Off-label):
   - 5 mg IV over 1-2 minutes q5min; total dose not to exceed 15 mg
Migraine (Off-label):
   - Prophylaxis
   - Metoprolol tartrate: 50-100 mg PO q12hr
Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter or Supraventricular Tachycardia (Off-label):
   - 2.5-5 mg IV q2-5min; not to exceed 15 mg over 10-15 minutes; maintenance: 25-100 mg PO q12hr
Dosing Modifications:
  Lopressor:
   - Renal impairment: No dosage adjustment necessary; systemic availability and half-life in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects
   - Hepatic impairment: Since drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol; elimination half-life of metoprolol is considerably prolonged, depending on severity (up to 7.2 hr)
  Kapspargo Sprinkle:
   - If a patient experiences symptomatic bradycardia, reduce dose
   - If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lower dose or temporarily discontinuing treatment
   - Do not increase until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized
   - Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce Kapspargo Sprinkle
   - or patients who are taking metoprolol succinate ER tablets at a dose of 25-200 mg PO qDay, substitute ER capsules for ER tablets, using the same total daily dose of metoprolol succinate
Dosing Considerations:
   - Switching from immediate-release to extended-release: Use same total daily dose of metoprolol
   - Switching between oral and IV dosage forms: Equivalent beta-blocking effect is achieved in 2.5:1 (oral-to-IV) ratio

   - Imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam are cleared from the circulation during hemodialysis
   - For patients maintained on hemodialysis, administer after hemodialysis and at intervals timed from the end of that hemodialysis session
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam are primarily cleared renally; therefore, hepatic impairment is not likely to have any effect on systemic exposures
Dosing Considerations:
   - Treatment duration depends on severity, infection location, and clinical response
  Susceptible gram-negative microorganisms:
   - HABP/VABP: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens

  Usage:
   - To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of antibacterial drugs, use only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria
   - When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy
   - In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy

   - Oral capsules: 5 mg/m² PO 1-3 hr before and q2-4hr after chemotherapy; may be increased in 2.5 mg/m² increments to 15 mg/m²; not to exceed 4-6 doses/day  
  Oral solution:
   - Starting dose: 4.2 mg/m² PO 1-3 hr before chemotherapy, THEN q2-4 hr after chemotherapy for a total of 4-6 doses/day
   - Give first dose on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before a meal; subsequent doses can be given without regard to meals
   - Calculate starting dose Starting dose (mg) = Patient body surface area (BSA) in m² multiplied by 4.2 mg/m² Round dose to the nearest 0.1 mg increment To correspond with the calibrated oral dosing syringe, the dose may need to be rounded to the nearest 0.1 mL increment 
   - Starting dose (mg) = Patient body surface area (BSA) in m² multiplied by 4.2 mg/m²
   - Round dose to the nearest 0.1 mg increment
   - To correspond with the calibrated oral dosing syringe, the dose may need to be rounded to the nearest 0.1 mL increment
   - Dose titration Titrate to clinical response during a chemotherapy cycle or subsequent cycles, based upon initial effect, as tolerated to achieve a clinical effect, in increments of 2.1 mg/m² Maximum dosage: 12.6 mg/m² per dose for 4-6 doses/day Adverse reactions are dose-related and psychiatric symptoms increase significantly at the maximum dosage 
   - Titrate to clinical response during a chemotherapy cycle or subsequent cycles, based upon initial effect, as tolerated to achieve a clinical effect, in increments of 2.1 mg/m²
   - Maximum dosage: 12.6 mg/m² per dose for 4-6 doses/day
   - Adverse reactions are dose-related and psychiatric symptoms increase significantly at the maximum dosage
Anorexia:
   - Indicated for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS
   - Oral capsules: 2.5 mg PO q12hr initially, taken right before meals; may be increased to no more than 20 mg/day or decreased to 2.5 mg at bedtime PRN 
  Oral solution:
   - Starting dose 2.1 mg PO BID, 1 hr before lunch and 1 hr before dinner Dosing later in the day may reduce the frequency of CNS adverse reactions If CNS adverse reactions of feeling high, dizziness, confusion, and somnolence occur, they usually resolve in 1-3 days and usually do not require dosage reduction If CNS adverse reactions are severe or persistent, reduce the dose to 2.1 mg qDay 1 hr before dinner or in the evening at bedtime 
   - 2.1 mg PO BID, 1 hr before lunch and 1 hr before dinner Dosing later in the day may reduce the frequency of CNS adverse reactions
   - If CNS adverse reactions of feeling high, dizziness, confusion, and somnolence occur, they usually resolve in 1-3 days and usually do not require dosage reduction
   - If CNS adverse reactions are severe or persistent, reduce the dose to 2.1 mg qDay 1 hr before dinner or in the evening at bedtime
   - Dose titration If tolerated and further therapeutic required, increase dose gradually to 2.1 mg 1 hr before lunch and 4.2 mg 1 hr before dinner Gradually increase dose to reduce the frequency of dose-related adverse reactions Most patients respond to 2.1 mg BID, but the dose may be further increased to 4.2 mg 1 hr before lunch and 4.2 mg 1 hr before dinner, as tolerated to achieve a therapeutic effect Maximum dosage: 8.4 mg BID 
   - If tolerated and further therapeutic required, increase dose gradually to 2.1 mg 1 hr before lunch and 4.2 mg 1 hr before dinner
   - Gradually increase dose to reduce the frequency of dose-related adverse reactions
   - Most patients respond to 2.1 mg BID, but the dose may be further increased to 4.2 mg 1 hr before lunch and 4.2 mg 1 hr before dinner, as tolerated to achieve a therapeutic effect
   - Maximum dosage: 8.4 mg BID
Dosing Considerations:
   - The pharmacologic effects of dronabinol are dose-related and subject to considerable interpatient variability; dosage individualization is critical in achieving maximum benefit of dronabinol capsules treatment

von Willebrand Disease, Routine Prophylaxis:
   - Indicated for routine prophylaxis to reduce bleeding episode frequency in patients with severe Type 3 VWD receiving on-demand therapy 
   - Initial: 40-60 IU/kg IV twice weekly
   - Adjust prophylaxis dose up to 60 IU/kg twice weekly if breakthrough bleeding occurs in joints or if severe bleeding occurs 
   - Treat breakthrough bleeding as per dosing guidelines for minor and major bleeding episodes 
Dosing Considerations:
   - Hemostasis cannot be ensured until factor VIII coagulation activity (FVIII:C) has reached 0.4 IU/mL (40% of normal activity)
   - If the patient's baseline plasma FVIII:C level is &lt;40% or is unknown, it is necessary to administer an approved recombinant (non-von Willebrand factor containing) factor VIII with the first infusion of rVWF in order to achieve a hemostatic plasma level of FVIII:C
   - However, if an immediate rise in FVIII:C is not necessary or if the baseline FVIII:C level is sufficient to ensure hemostasis, rVWF may be administered without recombinant factor VIII

   - ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guideline Recommendations (2018) for adults ≥20 years
  Primary prevention:
   - LDL-C lowering by ≥50%: High-intensity therapy agent atorvastatin or rosuvastatin recommended
   - Type 1 or 2 diabetes (40-75 years of age): Moderate-intensity therapy: 20-40 mg simvastatin PO qDay
   - Type 1 or 2 diabetes (40-75 years of age and 10 year estimated risk of ASCVD ≥7.5%): High-intensity therapy agent atorvastatin or rosuvastatin recommended
   - 40-75 years of age and 10 year estimated risk of ASCVD ≥7.5% : Moderate-intensity therapy: 20-40 mg simvastatin PO qDay; may consider high-intensity therapy agent atorvastatin or rosuvastatin
  Secondary prevention:
   - Presence of ASCVD, including stroke/TIA or peripheral arterial disease believed to be of atherosclerotic origin or post-CABG
   - ≤75 years: Treat with high-intensity therapy agent atorvastatin or rosuvastatin
   - &gt;75 years: Administer 20-40 mg simvastatin PO qDay (moderate-intensity therapy); not candidate for high-intensity therapy
Dosage Modifications:
  Renal impariment:
   - Severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min): 5 mg qDay initially
  Hepatic impairment :
   - Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis: Contraindicated 
  Drug interactions :
   - Coadministration with dronedarone, verapamil, or diltiazem: Do not exceed 10 mg/day 
   - Coadministration with avacopan: Do not exceed 10 mg/day (or 20 mg/day in those previously tolerating 80 mg/day for at least 1 yr without evidence of muscle toxicity)
   - Coadministration with amiodarone, amlodipine, or ranolazine: Do not exceed 20 mg/day 
   - Coadministration with vadadustat: 5 mg qDay initially; do not exceed 20 mg/day 
   - Coadministration with lomitapide: Reduce simvastatin dose by 50%, and do not exceed 20 mg/day (or 40 mg/day in those previously tolerating 80 mg/day) when initiating lomitapide 
Dosing Considerations:
   - Lipid determinations should be performed after 4 weeks of therapy and periodically thereafter
   - Limitation of use (oral suspension): Not studied in conditions where the major abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons (ie, hyperlipidemia Fredrickson types I and V)
  Restricted dosing:
   - 80 mg/day should be used only for individuals who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg chronically (eg, ≥12 months) without evidence of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis
   - Patients tolerating 80 mg who need to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or associated with a maximum dose for simvastatin should be switched to an alternative statin with less potential for drug-drug interactions
   - Patients unable to achieve their LDL-C goal utilizing 40 mg/day should not be titrated to 80 mg (increased risk for myopathy) but should instead be placed on alternative LDL-C-lowering treatment that provides greater LDL-C lowering
  Overdose management:
   - Adverse drug reactions from overdose may include peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, increased K+, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, elevated LFTs, and eye lens opacities
   - Treatment is supportive

   - Indicated to reduce the need for allogeneic RBC transfusions in patients with perioperative hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL but ≤13 g/dL who are at high risk for perioperative blood loss from elective, noncardiac, nonvascular surgery
   - 300 units/kg SC once daily for 15 consecutive days (10 days preceding surgery, day of surgery, 4 days following surgery)  
   - Alternatively, 600 units/kg SC in 4 doses administered 21, 14, and 7 days before surgery and on day of surgery
   - Concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is recommended
Dosing Considerations:
   - Evaluate iron status before and during treatment, and maintain iron repletion
   - Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (eg, vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiating therapy
  Selection of formulation:
   - Use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) for pregnant females, lactating females, neonates, and infants
  CKD-associated anemia:
   - When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor Hgb levels at least weekly until stable, then at least monthly
   - Consider rate of hemoglobin rise or decline, responsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), and hemoglobin variability
   - Do not increase the dose more frequently than q4weeks
   - Decreases in dose can occur more frequently; avoid frequent dose adjustment
   - If hemoglobin rises rapidly (eg, &gt;1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce dose by ≥25% as needed to reduce rapid responses; may reduce dose more frequently than once q4weeks; avoid frequent dose adjustments
   - Inadequate response (eg, if Hgb does not increase by &gt;1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy): Increase dose by 25%; if inadequate response over 12-week escalation period, further dose increase is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks
   - Individualize dosing, and use lowest dose that will maintain hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce need for RBC transfusions; discontinue if responsiveness does not improve
  Limitations of use:
   - Not shown to improve quality of life, fatigue, or patient well-being
   -  Not indicated for use Patients with cancer receiving hormonal agents, biologic products, or radiotherapy, unless also receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy in whom the anemia can be managed by transfusion Patients scheduled for surgery who are willing to donate autologous blood Patients undergoing cardiac or vascular surgery As a substitute for RBC transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia 
   - Patients with cancer receiving hormonal agents, biologic products, or radiotherapy, unless also receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy

   - FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) for chloroquine June 15, 2020 
   - Based on its ongoing analysis of the EUA and emerging scientific data, the FDA determined that chloroquine is unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA; additionally, in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of chloroquine no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the EUA
   - While additional clinical trials may continue to evaluate potential benefit, the FDA determined the EUA was no longer appropriate
   - The NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines recommend against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and in nonhospitalized patients

   - Switching from warfarin to apixaban: Discontinue warfarin and initiate apixaban when INR &lt;2.0
  Switching from apixaban to warfarin:
   - Apixaban affects INR, so measurements during coadministration with warfarin may not determine appropriate warfarin dose
   - If continuous anticoagulation is necessary, discontinue apixaban and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of apixaban would have been taken
   - Discontinue parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable level
  Surgery/procedures:
   - Discontinue at least 48 hr before elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding
   - Discontinue at least 24 hr before elective surgery or invasive procedures with low risk of unacceptable bleeding or where bleeding would be noncritical in location and easily controlled

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Dermal Procedures:
  Minor dermatological procedures:
   - Cream: Apply 2.5 g over 20-25 cm² of skin surface area for at least 1 hr
  Painful dermatological procedures involving large areas (eg, split thickness skin graft harvesting):
   - Cream: Apply 2 g/10 cm² of skin and allow to remain in contact with the skin for at least 2 hr
   - Analgesia is achieved in 1 hr, reaches maximum in 2-3 hr, and persists 1-2 hr after removal
Topical Anesthetic on Genital Mucous Membranes:
  Superficial minor surgery on male genitalia and as pretreatment for infiltration anesthesia:
   - Cream: Apply 1 g/10 cm² of skin for 15 min
  Minor procedures on the female external genitalia (eg, condylomata acuminata) as well as for use as pretreatment for anesthetic infiltration :
   - Cream: Apply 5-10 g for 5-10 min
Dental Procedures:
   - Localized anesthesia in periodontal pockets during scaling and/or root planing
   - Dental gel: Apply one cartridge or less for one quadrant of dentition; do not exceed 5 cartridges per treatment session
Dosing Considerations:
  Cream:
   - Gently squeeze cream out of the tube as a narrow strip that is 1.5 inches long and 0.2 inches wide; 1 strip corresponds to 1 g
   - Perform local anesthetic infiltration immediately after removal of cream
   - Male genital skin: Analgesia will increase up to 3 hours under occlusive dressing and persist 1-2 hours after cream removal
   - Female genital skin: Occlusive dressing is not necessary but will keep cream in place
  Dental gel:
   - Anesthetic effect lasts approximately 20 minute; if effect wears off, reapply if needed; one cartridge or less is sufficient for one quadrant of dentition
Administration :
  Cream:
   - Apply a thick layer to intact skin and cover with occlusive dressing
   - Female genital skin: Patient should be lying down during administration, especially if no occlusion is used
  Dental gel :
   - Do not inject; only use product with blunt-tipped applicator
   - Apply on gingival margin around selected teeth using the blunt–tipped applicator included in package; wait 30 seconds, and fill the periodontal pockets with gel using the blunt–tipped applicator until it becomes visible at the gingival margin; wait another 30 seconds before starting treatment
   - If a gel has formed, place in refrigerator (do not freeze) until it becomes a liquid again; only administer when it is a liquid
Other Indications &amp; Uses:
   - Provides dermal analgesia through intact skin by release of local anesthetics through epidermis

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Local Anesthetic Procedures:
  Cream:
   - Neonates (gestation age &lt;37 weeks): Use not recommended
   - &lt;12 months: Do not use if receiving treatment with methemoglobinemia-inducing agents
   - 0-3 months (or &lt;5 kg): Do not exceed 1 g total dose/application area &gt; 10 cm²/&gt;1 hr application time
   - 3-12 months (and &gt;5 kg): Do not exceed 2 g total dose/application area &gt; 20 cm²/&gt;4 hr application time
   - 1-6 years (and &gt;10 kg): Do not exceed 10 g total dose/application area &gt; 100 cm²/&gt;4 hr application time
   - 7-12 years (and &gt;20 kg): Do not exceed 20 g total dose/application area &gt; 200 cm²/&gt;4 hr application time
Dosing Considerations:
  Cream:
   - If patient &gt;3 months does not meet minimum weight requirement, total dose should correspond to patient’s weight
   - Care must be taken to avoid accidental ingestion of cream; use secondary protective covering to present disruption of application site</rdf:hasDose></rdf:Description>

RSV Prophylaxis:
   - Indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk of RSV disease
   - 15 mg/kg IM q1Month during RSV season with first dose administered prior to the season  
  High risk for RSV:
   - Children (≤2 yr) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia
   - Infants with a history of premature birth (≤35 weeks gestational age)
   - Children (≤2 yr) with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease
  AAP guidelines:
   - Limit RSV prophylaxis to infants born before 29 weeks' gestation and to infants with chronic illness (eg, congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease)
   - Give infants who qualify for prophylaxis in the first year of life no more than 5 monthly doses of palivizumab (15 mg/kg per dose) during the RSV season
   - In the second year of life, palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended only for children who needed supplemental oxygen for ≥28 days after birth and who continue to need medical intervention (supplemental oxygen, chronic corticosteroid, or diuretic therapy)
   - Clinicians may consider prophylaxis for children &lt;24 months if they will be profoundly immunocompromised during the RSV season
   - Owing to the shift in RSV seasonality noted in spring 2021 and the surge of RSV cases in fall 2022, AAP supports providing &gt;5 consecutive doses to eligible children in regions with disease activity lasting more than the typical 6-month duration 
   - AAP Updated Guidance: Use of palivizumab prophylaxis to prevent hospitalization from severe RSV infection during the 2022-2023 RSV season</rdf:hasDose></rdf:Description>

   - Males: ≥19 years: 16 mg/day
   - Females: ≥19 years: 14 mg/day
   - Pregnant women: 18 mg/day
   - Breastfeeding: 17 mg/day
Dietary supplement (OTC):
   - 50 mg PO q12hr or 100 mg PO qDay; many formulations exist
Hyperlipidemia:
   - Immediate-release: 250 mg PO once daily; dose or frequency adjusted every 4-7 days on basis of effect and tolerance to first-level therapeutic dose of 1.5-2 g PO divided q6-8hr, then adjusted every 2-4 weeks; not to exceed 6 g/day
   - Extended-release: 500 mg/day PO at bedtime initially; dose adjusted every 4 weeks on basis of effect and tolerance to therapeutic dose of 1-2 g once daily; not to exceed 1-2 g/day
  Indications:
   - Reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia
   - Indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with history of MI and hyperlipidemia
   - Indicated in combination with a bile acid binding resin to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease in patients with history of CAD and hyperlipidemia, and also to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adults with primary hyperlipidemia
   - Indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them
   - Extended release niacin did not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients treated with simvastatin in a large rantomized trial
Dosing Considerations:
   - Limitations of use: Extended-release niacin did not reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality among patients treated with simvastatin in a large rantomized trial
   - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) will decrease flushing when administered 30-60 minutes before dosing
   - Monitor liver function tests (LFTs)
  Indication for use with statins withdrawn by FDA:
   - April 15, 2016: Based on several large cardiovascular outcome trials including AIM-HIGH, ACCORD, and HPS2-THRIVE, the FDA decided that "scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in triglyceride levels and/or increase in HDL-cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events"
   - Consistent with this conclusion, the FDA has determined that the benefits of niacin ER tablets for coadministration with statins no longer outweigh the risks, and the approval for this indication should be withdrawn
  Overdose management:
   - Symptoms of acute overdose include flushing, GI distress, and pruritus
   - Chronic overdose has been associated with hepatitis
   - Treatment is symptomatic

   - eGFR 15-29 mL/min: 1.25 g IV q12hr
  Hepatic impairment :
   - Cefepime and enmetazobactam are primarily cleared renally; therefore, hepatic impairment is not likely to have a significant effect on systemic exposures
Dosing Considerations :
  Usage :
   - To reduce development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain antibacterial effectiveness, use only for infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria
   - Use culture and susceptibility information (when available) to select or modify antibacterial therapy
   - In absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Hypokalemia:
  Mild to moderate:
   - Capsules or tablets: 40-100 mEq PO qDay in divided doses; single dose not to exceed 25 mEq to minimize GI discomfort
   - Oral solution: 40-100 mEq PO qDay in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit single doses to 40 mEq/dose; not to exceed 200 mEq/24hr
   - Aternatively, 10-20 mEq PO BID/QID (20-80 mEq/day)
  Severe hypokalemia:
   - 40 mEq PO TID/QID; may also administer 20 mEq PO BID/TID in addition to IV potassium administration with careful monitoring; doses &gt;40 mEq are typically not well tolerated orally, resulting in GI irritation and nausea
Hypokalemia Prophylaxis:
   - 20-40 mEq PO qDay or divided BID
  Dosing considerations:
   - Dosing varies; adjust to serum potassium levels
IV intermittent infusions:
   - ≤10 mEq/hr; repeat as needed based on lab values done frequently; central line infusion and continuous ECG monitoring recommended for infusions &gt;10 mEq/hr
   - 10 mEq of potassium chloride increases serum potassium levels by approximately 0.1 mEq/.L
  Dosing based on serum potassium:
   - 2.5-3.5 mEq/L: 10 mEq/hr maximum infusion rate; 40 mEq/L maximum concentration; not to exceed 200 mEq dose/24hr
   - &lt;2.5 mEq/L or symptomatic hypokalemia (excluding emergency treatment of cardiac arrest): 40 mEq/hr maximum infusion rate (central line only) in presence of continuous ECG monitoring and frequent lab monitoring; patients may require up to 400 mEq/24hr
Dosing Modifications:
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Patients with cirrhosis should usually be started at low end of dosing range, and serum potassium level should be monitored frequently
  Renal impairment:
   - Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if patient is on RAAS inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, should usually be started at low end of dosing range because of potential for development of hyperkalemia; serum potassium level should be monitored frequently; renal function should be assessed periodically

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Hypokalemia prophylaxis :
   - For ongoing drug losses, including diuretic
   - &gt;1 month: 1-2 mEq/kg qDay of BID; single dose not to exceed usual adult single dose of 20 mEq/dose, although some patients may require a single dose up to 40 mEq/dose or higher based on lab values and ongoing losses  
Hypokalemia:
   Mild to moderate:
   - &gt;1 month: 2-5 mEq/kg PO in divided doses; not to exceed 1-2 mEq/kg as single dose or 20 mEq/kg, whichever is less; consider IV administration if deficit severe or ongoing losses great  
   Severe:
   - 0.5-1 mEq/kg/dose; not to exceed 40 mEq/dose; infuse at 0.5 mEq/kg/hr; evaluate serum concentrations 1-2 hr after completion of infusion; repeat as necessary based on lab values; severe depletion or ongoing losses may require &gt;200% of normal daily maintenance</rdf:hasDose></rdf:Description>

   - &gt;55 years or debilitated or ASA III/IV: 20 mg IVP q10sec until onset (1-1.5 mg/kg); do not use rapid bolus because as it will increase likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression, including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation
  Maintenance:
   - &lt;55 years ASA I/II: 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/min IV; administered in a variable rate infusion with nitrous oxide 60% to 70% and oxygen provides anesthesia for patients undergoing general surgery; maintenance infusion should immediately follow induction dose to provide satisfactory or continuous anesthesia during induction phase
   - Intermittent bolus: Increments of 25-50 mg (2.5-5 mL) may be administered with nitrous oxide in adults undergoing general surgery; administer incremental boluses when changes in vital signs indicate response to surgical stimulation or light anesthesia
   - &gt;55 years or debilitated or ASA III/IV: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/min IV
MAC Sedation:
  Initiation:
   - 0.1-0.15 mg/kg/min IV for 3-5 min; titrate to desired clinical effect; monitor respiratory function; administered as slow infusion or slow injection while monitoring cardiorespiratory function  
   - Slow injection: 0.5 mg/kg administered over 3-5 min; titrate to clinical response
   - Elderly: Do not use rapid bolus dose administration; administer over 3-5 min; reduce dose to approximately 80% of usual adult dose according to their condition, response, and changes in vital signs
  Maintenance:
   - Variable rate of infusion method preferable over intermittent bolus dose method
   - Variable rate infusion method: 0.025-0.075 mg/kg/min IV during first 10-15 min sedation maintenance; subsequently decrease infusion rates over time to 25 to 50 mcg/kg/min and adjust clinical response; allow approximately 2 min for onset of peak drug effect to titrate to clinical response; titrate downward in absence of clinical signs of light sedation until mild response to stimulation obtained to avoid sedative administration at rates higher than clinically necessary
   - Intermittent bolus method: Administer 10-20 mg increments and titrate to desired level of sedation
   - Elderly: 0.02-0.06 mg/kg/min IV; do not use rapid bolus dose administration; reduce rate of administration to 80% of usual adult dose according to their condition, response, and changes in vital signs
Postoperative Nausea/Vomiting:
   - 20 mg IV; may repeat
ICU Patient:
   - Initiation: 0.005 mg/kg/min IV for at least 5 min; titrate to desired clinical effect; increase by 5-10 mcg/kg/min over 5-10 min intervals until desired sedation level achieved; allow a minimum of 5 min between adjustments for onset of peak effect  
   - For medical ICU patients or patients who recovered from effect of general anesthesia or deep sedation, rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or more may be required to achieve adequate sedation
   - Maintenance: 0.005-0.05 mg/kg/min IV individualized and titrated to clinical response; (0.005 mg/kg/min increment increase q5min)
   - Discontinuation: Avoid discontinuation prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels; may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation

   - Indicated as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies (eg, statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) for the treatment of children aged ≥10 years with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C
   - &lt;10 years: Safety and efficacy not established
  10-17 years:
   - Initial: 420 mg SC once monthly 
   - May increase to 420 mg q2Weeks if a clinically meaningful response not achieved in 12 weeks
   - Patients on lipid apheresis may initiate treatment with 420 mg q2Weeks to correspond with apheresis schedule; administer evolocumab after completing apheresis session 
Dosing Considerations:
  HoFH:
   - Assess LDL-C when clinically appropriate; LDL-lowering effects may be measured as early as 4 weeks after initiation
   - Once-monthly dosing: Note that LDL-C can vary during dosing interval in some patients; recommend measuring LDL-C just before next scheduled dose

   - Dosing Modifications
  Renal impairment:
   -  Ventricular arrhythmia (PO) CrCl &gt;60 mL/min: Give q12hr CrCl 30-59 mL/min: Give q24hr CrCl 10-29 mL/min: Give q36-48hr CrCl &lt;10 mL/min: Individualize dose 
   - CrCl &gt;60 mL/min: Give q12hr
   - CrCl 30-59 mL/min: Give q24hr
   - CrCl 10-29 mL/min: Give q36-48hr
   - CrCl &lt;10 mL/min: Individualize dose
   -  Atrial fibrillation/flutter (PO) CrCl &gt;60 mL/min: Give q12hr CrCl 40-59 mL/min: Give q24hr CrCl &lt;40 mL/min: Contraindicated 
   - CrCl &gt;60 mL/min: Give q12hr
   - CrCl 40-59 mL/min: Give q24hr
   - CrCl &lt;40 mL/min: Contraindicated
Dosing Considerations:
  Monitoring before initiating or re-initiating:
   - Perform baseline ECG to determine QT interval and measure and normalize serum potassium and magnesium levels before initiating therapy
   - Measure serum creatinine and calculate estimated CrCl to establish appropriate dosing interval (if CrCl ≤60 mL/min dosing interval adjustment necessary)
   - Continue ECG monitoring with each uptitration in dose, until steady state reached
   - Determine QTc 2-4 hr after every dose; proarrhythmic event may occur after initiation of therapy and with each upward dosage adjustment
  Limitations of use:
   - AFIB/AFL: Because therapy with sotalol can cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, reserve use for patients in whom AFIB/AFL is highly symptomatic; patients with paroxysmal AFIB that is easily reversed (by Valsalva maneuver, for example) should usually not be treated

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Arrhythmias:
  Indications:
   - Indicated for treatment of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia; antiarrhythmic drugs may not enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias
   - Indicated for maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patient with highly symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter (AFIB/AFL) who are currently in sinus rhythm 
  2 years or older:
   - Normal renal function: 30 mg/m2 PO TID initially (90 mg/m2 total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to initial 160 mg total daily dose for adults  
   - Subsequent titration to maximum 60 mg/m2 TID (approximately equivalent to the 320 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur
   - Guide titration by clinical response, heart rate and QTc, with increased dosing preferably carried out in-hospital
   - Allow at least 36 hr between dose increments to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of drug in patients with age-adjusted normal renal function
  &lt;2 years :
   - Pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age
   - Use graph in prescribing information where age in months is plotted on a logarithmic scale; see manufacturer's package insert for details
   -  Examples Child aged 20 months: Dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged ≥2, which is about 30 mg should be multiplied by about 0.97, which is the age factor (30 X 0.97) for a dose of 29.1 mg/m2  Child aged 1 week: Initial starting dose (30 mg) should be multiplied by age factor 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 X 0.3) for a dose of 9 mg/m2 
   - Child aged 20 months: Dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged ≥2, which is about 30 mg should be multiplied by about 0.97, which is the age factor (30 X 0.97) for a dose of 29.1 mg/m2 
   - Child aged 1 week: Initial starting dose (30 mg) should be multiplied by age factor 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 X 0.3) for a dose of 9 mg/m2</rdf:hasDose></rdf:Description>

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia:
   - Indicated as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid lowering treatments, including LDL apheresis where available, to reduce LDL-C, TC, apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
   - Initial: 5 mg PO qDay; may gradually increase dose based on tolerability and response, not to exceed 60 mg/day
  Dose titration:
   - 5 mg/day, wait at least 2 weeks before increasing to 10 mg/day
   - Wait at least 4 weeks before increasing dose to next dosage if on 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, or 40 mg/day
   - Not to exceed 60 mg/day
Dosage Modifications:
   - Coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: Contraindicated
   - Coadministration with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (including atorvastatin and oral contraceptives): Not to exceed 30 mg/day
  Renal impairment:
   - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving dialysis: Not to exceed 40 mg/day
   - Mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, including those with ESRD not yet receiving dialysis: Not studied; however, may increase lomitapide exposure &gt;50%
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Baseline moderate-to-severe (Child-Pugh B or C): Contraindicated
   - Baseline mild (Child-Pugh A): Not to exceed 40 mg/day
  Elevated ALT or AST ≥3x and &lt;5x ULN:
   - Confirm elevation with a repeat measurement within 1 week
   - If confirmed, reduce the dose and obtain additional liver-related tests if not already measured (eg, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, INR)
   - Repeat tests weekly and withhold dosing with signs of abnormal liver function (eg, increased bilirubin or INR), if transaminase levels &gt;5x ULN, or if transaminase levels do not fall below 3x ULN within approximately 4 weeks
   - In these cases of persistent or worsening abnormalities, also investigate to identify the probable cause
   - If dosing resumed after transaminases resolve to &lt;3x ULN, consider reducing the dose and monitor liver-related tests more frequently
  Elevated ALT or AST ≥5x ULN:
   - Withhold dosing, obtain additional liver related tests if not already measured (eg, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, INR), and investigate to identify the probable cause
   - If transaminase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, lethargy, flu-like symptoms), increases in bilirubin ≥2x ULN, or active liver disease, discontinue therapy and investigate to identify the probable cause
   - If dosing resumed after transaminases resolve to &lt;3x ULN, reduce the dose and monitor liver-related tests more frequently
Dosing Considerations:
   - Because of hepatotoxicity risk, available only through a restricted access program
   - Because of lomitapide’s action in the small intestine, administer with daily supplements that contain vitamin E 400 IU, linoleic acid 200 mg, alpha-linolenic acid 210 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid 110 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid 80 mg to reduce the risk of developing a fat-soluble nutrient deficiency
  Obtain baseline tests:
   - Before initiating, measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin
   - Obtain negative pregnancy test in women of reproductive potential
   - Initiate a low-fat diet (ie, &lt;20% of energy from fat)
  Limitation of Use:
   - The safety and effectiveness of lomitapide have not been established in patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
   - The effect of lomitapide on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Hypertension:
   - Initial (not on diuretic): 2.5 mg PO qDay
   - Initial (with diuretic): 1.25 mg PO qDay
   - Maintenance: 2.5-20 mg/day PO qDay or divided q12hr
Heart Failure (Post-Myocardial Infarction):
   - Stable patients with CHF signs within a few days of acute MI
   - Initial: 2.5 mg PO q12hr; may titrate to 5 mg PO q12hr; decrease to 1.25 mg q12hr if hypotension occurs; monitor for &gt;2 hr after initial dose and reduce concomitant diuretic if hypotension occurs
   - Maintenance: After 1 week, increase dose (if tolerated) to target dose of 5 mg q12hr
Myocardial Infarction/Stroke Prevention:
   - Reduce risk of MI, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes in patients ≥55 years
   - Initial: 2.5 mg PO qDay for 1 week, THEN 5 mg qDay for 3 weeks
   - Maintenance: Increase as tolerated to 10 mg qDay; for hypertensive or recently post-MI patients, give 5 mg PO BID
  Dosing considerations:
   - Reduce risk of MI, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes in patients ≥55 years at high risk of developing a major cardiovascular event because of a history of coronary artery disease, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease, or of diabetes that is accompanied by at least 1 other cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low HDL levels, cigarette smoking, or documented microalbuminuria)
Diabetic Nephropathy (Off-label):
   - Initial (not on diuretic): 2.5 mg PO qDay
   - Initial (with diuretic): 1.25 mg PO qDay
   - Maintenance: 2.5-20 mg PO qDay; daily dose may be either increased or divided BID if antihypertensive effect is diminished toward the end of the dosing interval
Dosage Modifications:
  Renal impairment:
   - CrCl &lt;40 mL/min and concomitant diuretic therapy: Not to exceed 5 mg/day (25% of normal dose)
   - Renal/heart failure: 1.25 mg PO qDay; may increase to 1.25 mg q12hr and to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg q12hr depending on clinical response and tolerability
   - Renal failure and hypertension: 1.25 mg PO qDay initially; may titrate upward, not to exceed 5 mg/day
   - Geriatric patients: At increased risk for renal dysfunction; adjust dose to renal clearance and monitor closely
Dosing Considerations:
   - Requires weeks for full effect; to start, use low dose and titrate every 1-2 weeks
   - qDay dosing may result in diminished antihypertensive effect at end of day in some patients; consider increase in dosage or dosing interval (q12hr)
   - If BP is not adequately treated, consider adding diuretic
   - Consider ACE inhibitor in high-risk patients, even if no hypertension or CHF
   - Abrupt discontinuance not associated with rapid increase in BP 
Administration:
   - Swallow capsule whole; can also open capsule and sprinkle contents on small amount of applesauce or mixed in 120 mL of water or apple juice; mixture can be stored for &lt;24 hours at room temperature or &lt;48 hours under refrigeration

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Hypertension:
   - 150 mg/12.5 mg PO qDay initially; if needed, after 1-2 weeks may titrate up to 300 mg/25 mg PO qDay
  Hepatic impairment:
   - No dosage adjustment necessary in patients with hepatic impairment
  Renal impairment:
   - Usual regimens of therapy may be followed as long as the patient’s creatinine clearance is &gt;30 mL/min; in patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so this drug combination is not recommended
Dosing considerations:
   - Not recommended as initial therapy in patients with intravascular volume depletion
   - Maximum antihypertensive effects are attained within 2-4 weeks after change in dose
   - In patients not controlled on monotherapy with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide, recommended doses of this drug combination, in order of increasing mean effect, are (irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) 150/12.5 mg, 300/12.5 mg, and 300/25 mg; the largest incremental effect will likely be in the transition from monotherapy to 150/12.5 mg

Complicated Urinary Tract Infections:
   - Indicated for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), including pyelonephritis caused by the following susceptible microorganism(s): Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae
   - Limited clinical safety and efficacy data are currently available, reserve treatment for use in cUTI patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options
   - 15 mg/kg IV q24hr infused over 30 minutes
   - Duration of therapy should be guided by the severity of infection and the patient’s clinical status for up to 7 days; usual duration 4-7 days
   - An appropriate oral therapy may be considered after 4-7 days of therapy to complete a total duration of 7-10 days (IV plus oral); maximum duration of therapy for cUTI is 7 days
   - Also see Dosage Modifications and Administration
Sepsis:
   - Pending FDA approval for acute bloodstream infections caused by multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
Dosage Modifications:
  Renal impairment:
   - CrCl ≥60 to 90 mL/min: 15 mg/kg IV q24hr
   - CrCl ≥30 to 60 mL/min: 10 mg/kg IV q24hr
   - CrCl ≥15 to 30 mL/min: 10 mg/kg IV q48hr
   - CrCl &lt;15 mL/min, hemodialysis, or continuous renal replacement: Insufficient information
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Pharmacokinetics of plazomicin are unknown
Dosing Considerations:
   - To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of pIazomicin and other antibacterial drugs, use only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria
   - When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy; local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy when such data are unavailable
  Monitoring :
   - Assess CrCl in all patients prior to initiating therapy and daily during therapy
   - CrCl≥15 to &lt;90 mL/min: Maintain plasma trough concentrations &lt;3 mcg/mL; measure trough levels ~30 minutes before administration of the second dose of plazomicin
   - Estimate CrCl by the Cockcroft-Gault formula using total body weight (TBW) for patients with TBW greater than ideal body weight (IBW) by 25% or more, use IBW
   - Calculate dosage using TBW; for patients with TBW greater than IBW by 25% or more, use adjusted body weight based on the equation (Adjusted body weight = IBW + 0.4 × [TBW – IBW])
   - Dosage adjustment based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) involves extending dosing interval by 1.5 fold (ie, from q24hr to q36 hr or from q48hr to q72 hr) for patients with plasma trough concentrations ≥3 mcg/mL
   - In the setting of worsening renal function, assess the benefit of continuing therapy

  Hepatic impairment :
   - Mild-to-moderate: No dosage adjustment necessary
   - Severe: No data
Dosing Considerations:
  Limitations of use:
   - Cobicistat is not interchangeable with ritonavir and cobicistat use is not recommended to increase systemic exposure of darunavir 600 mg BID, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir due to lack of exposure data
   - Complex or unknown mechanisms of drug interactions preclude extrapolation of ritonavir drug interactions to certain cobicistat interactions
   - Cobicistat and ritonavir when administered with either atazanavir or darunavir may result in different drug interactions when used with concomitant medications
  Laboratory testing before and during treatment:
   - Before initiating: Test for hepatitis B infection
   - Before initiating and during treatment: Assess eCrCl; cobicistat decreases eCrCl because of tubular secretion inhibition of creatinine; however, it does not affect actual renal glomerular function
   - Coadministration with tenofovir DF: Assess eCrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein at baseline
   - Patients with chronic kidney disease: Assess eCrCl, urine glucose, urine protein, and serum phosphorus at baseline
  Not recommended during pregnancy:
   - Do not initiate cobicistat with darunavir or atazanavir during pregnancy
   - Coadministered with darunavir or atazanavir is not recommended during pregnancy owing to substantially lower systemic exposures of darunavir and cobicistat during the second and third trimesters

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Hypertension:
   - Not indicated for initial therapy; if fixed combination represents dose titrated to patient’s needs, therapy with combination may be more convenient than with separate components
   - Lopressor HCT: metoprolol tartrate 50-100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg PO daily in single or divided doses
   - Dutoprol: metoprolol succinate 25-100mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg PO qDay as a single dose
   - When necessary, another antihypertensive agent may be added, beginning with 50% of usual recommended starting dose to avoid excessive fall in blood pressure
   - To minimize dose-independent side effects, begin combination therapy only after patient fails to achieve desired effect with monotherapy
Renal Impairment:
   - Use caution in dosing/titrating patients with renal dysfunction
   - Cumulative effects of thiazides may develop with impaired renal function
Hepatic Impairment:
   - No studies performed with metoprolol in patients with hepatic impairment
   - Because metoprolol succinate is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function
   - Initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication, and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function
Other Information:
   - Combination may be substituted for titrated individual components
   - Withdraw gradually over a period of about 2 weeks
   - Geriatric: Start at low end of dosing range and titrate slowly

   - Hypertriglyceridemia: Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients with fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacological intervention
   - Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
  Indication for use with statins withdrawn by FDA:
   - April 15, 2016: Based on several large cardiovascular outcome trials including AIM-HIGH, ACCORD, and HPS2-THRIVE, the FDA decided that "scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in triglyceride levels and/or increase in HDL-cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events"
   - Consistent with this conclusion, the FDA has determined that the benefits of fenofibric-acid (delayed-release) capsules (eg, Trilipix) for coadministration with statins no longer outweigh the risks, and the approval for this indication should be withdrawn

   - Apixaban &gt;5 mg or dose unknown (&lt;8 hr from last dose or unknown)
Dosing Considerations:
  Accelerated approval:
   - Approved under accelerated approval based on the change from baseline in anti-FXa activity in healthy volunteers
   - An improvement in hemostasis has not been established
   - Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon the results of studies to demonstrate an improvement in hemostasis in patients
  Limitation of use:
   - Has not been shown effective for, and is not indicated for, treatment of bleeding related to any FXa inhibitors other than apixaban and rivaroxaban
  Restarting antithrombotic therapy:
   - Patients treated with FXa inhibitor therapy have underlying disease states that predispose them to thromboembolic events, thus reversing FXa inhibitor therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease
   - To reduce the risk of thrombosis, resume anticoagulant therapy as soon as medically appropriate after dose

Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blockade Reversal:
   - Indicated for nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) reversal after surgery, while decreasing the peripheral muscarinic effects (eg, bradycardia and excessive secretions) associated with cholinesterase inhibition following NMBA reversal administration 
   - 0.03-0.07 mg/kg neostigmine (0.006-0.014 mg/kg of glycopyrrolate) IV will achieve a train-of-four (TOF) twitch ratio of 90% (TOF0.9) within 10-20 min of administration
   - Neostigmine-induced bradycardia is minimized due to the included 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate per 1 mg neostigmine
   - Select dose based on extent of spontaneous recovery that has occurred at time of administration, half-life of NMBA being reversed, and whether there is a need to rapidly reverse the NMBA 
  Use 0.03 mg/kg dose of neostigmine (0.006 mg/kg of glycopyrrolate) for::
   - Reversal of NMBAs with shorter half-lives (eg, rocuronium) or
   - When first twitch response to TOF stimulus is &gt;10% of baseline or
   - When a second twitch is present
  Use 0.07 mg/kg dose of neostigmine (0.014 mg/kg of glycopyrrolate) for::
   - Reversal of NMBAs with longer half-lives (eg, vecuronium, pancuronium) or
   - When first twitch response is relatively weak (ie, not substantially &gt;10% of baseline) or 
   - There is a need for more rapid recovery 
   - Recommended maximum total dose is 0.07 mg/kg of neostigmine or up to a total of 5 mg of neostigmine, whichever is less
Dosage Modifications:
  Renal impairment:
   - No dosing adjustment necessary 
   - Closely monitor to assure the effects of the neuromuscular blocking agent, particularly one cleared by the kidneys, do not persist beyond those of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Neostigmine: Pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment not studied
   - Neostigmine is metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver, while glycopyrrolate is mostly eliminated unchanged by the kidney
   - No dosing adjustments necessary
Dosing Considerations:
   - Before administration and until complete recovery, patient should be well ventilated and patent airway maintained
   - Satisfactory recovery: Evaluate adequacy of skeletal muscle tone and respiratory measurements in addition to response to peripheral stimulation
   - There must be a twitch response to first stimulus in train-of-four (TOF) of at least 10% of its baseline level (ie, response before administering NMBA, before administering neostigmine/glycopyrrolate) 
   - Peripheral nerve stimulation devices capable of delivering a TOF stimulus are essential to effectively administering therapy
   - Continue to monitor TOF to evaluate the extent of recovery of neuromuscular function and if an additional dose of neostigmine/glycopyrrolate is necessary
   - Do NOT rely on TOF monitoring to determine the adequacy of reversal of neuromuscular blockade as related to a patient’s ability to ventilate and maintain a patent airway following tracheal extubation
   - Continue to monitor for adequacy of reversal from NMBAs for a period that ensures full recovery based on patient’s medical condition and pharmacokinetics of neostigmine and NMBA used

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blockade Reversal:
   - Indicated for nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) reversal after surgery, while decreasing the peripheral muscarinic effects (eg, bradycardia and excessive secretions) associated with cholinesterase inhibition following NMBA reversal administration
   - &lt;2 years: Not recommended as blood pressure in these patients is sensitive to changes in heart rate
  ≥2 years:
   - 0.03-0.07 mg/kg neostigmine (0.006-0.014 mg/kg of glycopyrrolate) IV will achieve a train-of-four (TOF) twitch ratio of 90% (TOF0.9) within 10-20 min of administration
   - Neostigmine-induced bradycardia is minimized due to the included 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate per 1 mg neostigmine
   - Select dose based on extent of spontaneous recovery that has occurred at time of administration, half-life of NMBA being reversed, and whether there is a need to rapidly reverse the NMBA
   -  Use 0.03 mg/kg dose of neostigmine (0.006 mg/kg of glycopyrrolate) for:   Reversal of NMBAs with shorter half-lives (eg, rocuronium) or When first twitch response to TOF stimulus is substantially &gt;10% of baseline or When a second twitch is present

HIV Infection:
   - Indicated for treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretrovirals; also used for prevention of maternal-fetal HIV transmission in women with no prior antiretroviral treatment
   - 200 mg PO qDay x 14 days, THEN
   - If no rash, increase to 200 mg BID, in combination with other antiretroviral agents; if rash occurs wait until it is resolved before increasing
   - Total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg for any patient
   - Prevention of maternal-fetal HIV transmission: 200 mg PO as a single dose at onset of labor, in combination with IV zidovudine
  Extended-release tablets:
   - Initial therapy: When initiating therapy, give immediate-release tablet 200 mg PO qDay for 14 days, then extended-release tablet 400 mg PO qDay thereafter
   - Switch from immediate-release: If already taking immediate-release regimen, may switch to extended-release 400 mg PO qDay without 14-day lead-in period of immediate-release nevirapine
Dosing Considerations:
   - Based on serious and life-threatening hepatotoxicity observed in controlled and uncontrolled trials, nevirapine should not be initiated in adult females with CD4+ cell counts &gt;250 cells/mm³ or in adult males with CD4+ cell counts &gt;400 cells/mm³ unless the benefit outweighs the risk
   - The 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release dosing must be strictly followed; it has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of rash
   - If nevirapine extended-release interrupted &gt;7 days, restart with lead-in dosing with immediate-release nevirapine
   - If rash persists beyond 14-day lead-in period, do not dose escalate to 200 mg twice daily; the 200 mg once-daily dosing regimen should not be continued beyond 28 days, at which point, an alternative regimen should be sought; discontinue also if severe rash develops or rash with elevated hepatic transaminases or with constitutional symptoms occur
  Patients with dose interruption:
   - For patients who interrupt dosing for more than 7 days, restart recommended dosing, using 200 mg once daily for first 14 days (lead-in) followed by 200 mg twice daily

Hypoprothrombinemia Due To Drugs or Factors Limiting Absorption or Synthesis:
   - 2.5-10 mg PO/SC; may be increased PRN to 25 mg or, rarely, to 50 mg; may be repeated in 12-48 hours
Reversal of Warfarin Effects:
   - Omit 1-2 doses, or hold warfarin; monitor INR and adjust warfarin dose accordingly
   - INR 4.5-10, no bleeding: 2012 ACCP guidelines suggest against routine use; 2008 ACCP guidelines suggest considering vitamin K1 (phytonadione) 1-2.5 mg PO once
   - INR &gt;10, no bleeding: 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend vitamin K1 PO (dose not specified); 2008 ACCP guidelines suggest 2.5-5 mg PO once; INR reduction observed within 24-48 hr, monitor INR and give additional vitamin K if needed
   - Minor bleeding, any elevated INR: Consider 2.5-5 mg PO once; may repeat if needed after 24 hr
   - Major bleeding, any elevated INR: 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend prothrombin complex concentrate, human (PCC, Kcentra) plus vitamin K1 5-10 mg IV (dilute in 50 mL IV fluid and infuse over 20 min)
   - NOTE: High vitamin K doses (ie, 10 mg or more) may cause warfarin resistance for a week or more; consider using heparin, LMWH, or direct thrombin inhibitors to provide adequate thrombosis prophylaxis in clinical conditions requiring chronic anticoagulation therapy (eg, atrial fibrillation)
Dosing Considerations:
   - PO dose may be repeated in 12-48 hr and SC/IV/IM dose in 6-8 hr if necessary
   - Avoid IM route; increases risk of hematoma formation
   - Oral route more effective than SC route in nonbleeding patients in warfarin associated coagulopathy
   - IV rate not to exceed 1 mg/min
   - May use IV route in selected nonbleeding patients; use IV route in patients with major bleeding due to warfarin associated coagulopathy
   - Use of high vitamin K doses (10-15 mg) may cause warfarin resistance for ≥1 week

Urinary Tract Infection :
   - Indicated for treatment of female adults with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus 
   - 185 mg PO TID x 3-7 days as clinically indicated
Dosage Modifications :
  Renal impairment :
   - Reductions in systemic elimination as well as urinary excretion of mecillinam (active metabolite) are anticipated with decreases in renal function
   - Clinical significance of these changes on efficacy is unknown
   - Available safety information does not suggest a need for dosage adjustment
  Hepatic impairment :
   - Dosage adjustments are not necessary
   - Hepatic impairment is not expected to alter elimination as hepatic metabolism/excretion represents a minor pathway of elimination
Dosing Considerations :
  Avoid development of resistant bacteria :
   - To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of pivmecillinam and other antibacterial drugs, use only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria
   - Use culture and susceptibility information (if available) when selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy
   - In absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric therapy selection

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Hypertension :
   - Not for initial therapy
   - Usual starting dose: 250 mg methyldopa/15-25 mg hydrochlorothiazide PO q12hr; alternatively 500 mgmethyldopa/30-50 mg hydrochlorothiazide PO qDay
   - Avoid hydrochlorothiazide doses &gt;50 mg qDay
   - Dosage strength determined by individual titration
Renal Impairment:
   - Use caution in dosing/titrating patients with renal dysfunction
   - Cumulative effects of thiazides may develop with impaired renal function; dose adjustment may be necessary; if CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min avoid use; azotemia may be precipitated
Administration:
   - To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy
   - Since both components have a relatively short duration of action, withdrawal is followed by return of hypertension usually within 48 hours, not complicated by overshoot of blood pressure

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Acute Myocardial Infarction:
   - 5 mg PO within 24 hours of onset of symptoms of acute MI, THEN 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours, and 10 mg qDay for 6 weeks
   - If patient has low systolic blood pressure (ie, ≤120 mm Hg) when treatment initiated or during the first 3 days, administer a lower dose of 2.5 mg
   - If hypotension occurs (systolic BP ≤100 mm Hg), a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg may be given, with temporary reductions to 2.5 mg if needed
  Dosing considerations:
   - Discontinue with prolonged hypotension (ie, systolic BP &lt;90 mm Hg for &gt;1 hr)
Hypertension:
   - Uncomplicated essential hypertension
   - Not taking diuretic: 10 mg PO qDay initially; usual range is 20-40 mg/day as single daily dose
  Dosing considerations:
   - Taking diuretic: Discontinue diuretic for 2-3 days before initiating lisinopril to reduce chance of hypotension; may resume diuretic if blood pressure is not controlled; if diuretic cannot be discontinued, initial dose of lisinopril 5 mg should be used under supervision for at least 2 hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least 1 hour
Heart Failure:
   - Adjunctive therapy with diuretics and (usually) digitalis
   - 5 mg PO qDay initially; increase by ≤10 mg no more frequent than 2 week intervals to 20-40 mg PO qDay
   - Patients with hypnatremia (&lt;130 mEq/L serum sodium): 2.5 mg PO qDay initially; increase by ≤10 mg no more frequent than 2 week intervals to 20-40 mg PO qDay
   - Usual effective dosage range: 5-40 mg PO qDay (Zestril); 5-20 mg PO qDay (Prinivil)
Dosage Modifications:
  Renal impairment:
   - Acute myocardial infarction: Use caution in renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL)
   - Hypertension and CrCl &gt;30 mL/min: 10 mg PO qDay initially; not to exceed 40 mg/day
   - Hypertension and CrCl 10-30 mL/min: 5 mg PO qDay initially; not to exceed 40 mg/day
   - Hypertension and CrCl &lt;10 mL/min or hemodialysis: 2.5 mg PO qDay initially; not to exceed 40 mg/day
   - Heart failure and CrCl &lt;30 mL/min: 2.5 mg PO qDay initially; not to exceed 40 mg/day
Diabetic Nephropathy (Off-label):
   - Initial: 5 mg PO qDay (with diuretic)
   - May gradually increase dose according to blood pressure response; dosage range is 20-40 mg/day
  Dosing considerations:
   - Long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors, usually combined with diuretics, reduces blood pressure and albuminuria and protects kidney function in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and nephropathy

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Hypertension:
   - Indicated for hypertension in pediatric patients aged ≥6 yr to lower blood pressure
   - Age &lt;6 years or GFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m²: Safety and efficacy not established
   - ≥6 years and GFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73m²: 0.07 mg/kg PO qDay initially, not to exceed 5 mg/day; may slowly titrate upward and adjusted according to blood pressure; not to exceed 0.61 mg/kg/day or &gt;40 mg/day  
Primary Hypertension (Orphan):
   - Oral solution: Orphan designation for treatment of primary hypertension with complications and secondary hypertension in pediatric patients (ages 0 through 16 years of age)

Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease:
   - Indicated for treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults who have been receiving dialysis for ≥3 months 
  Not being treated with an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) :
   - Starting dose: 300 mg PO qDay 
  Being switched from an ESA :
   - Starting dose: 300 mg PO qDay
   - Owing to the gradual rise in hemoglobin (Hb) with vadadustat, RBC transfusions or ESA treatment may be considered during transition phase if Hb values fall to &lt;9 g/dL or Hb response is considered unacceptable 
   - Patients receiving RBC transfusions should continue vadadustat during the transfusion period
   - Pause vadadustat for those patients receiving temporary ESA rescue treatment and resume when Hb levels ≥10 g/dL
   -  Depending on ESA used for rescue, extend pause in vadadustat treatment to   2 days after last dose of epoetin 7 days after last dose of darbepoetin alfa 14 days after last dose of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta  
   - 2 days after last dose of epoetin
   - 7 days after last dose of darbepoetin alfa
   - 14 days after last dose of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta
   - Following ESA rescue, resume vadadustat at previous dose or with a dose that is 150 mg greater than the prior dose, with subsequent titration
  Dose titration and monitoring :
   - Following vadadustat initiation and after each dose adjustment, monitor Hb levels q2Weeks until stable, then monitor at least monthly
   - Increase dose no more frequently than once q4Weeks 
   - Decreases in dose can occur more frequently
   - Adjust dose in 150-mg increments to achieve or maintain Hb levels within 10-11 g/dL
   - Doses may range from 150 mg to a maximum of 600 mg
   - When adjusting dose, consider the patient’s Hb variability, Hb rate of rise and rate of decline, and responsiveness to vadadustat
   -  A single Hb excursion may not require a dosing change   If Hb rises rapidly (eg, &gt;1 g/dL in any 2-week period or &gt;2 g/dL in 4 weeks), interrupt dosing or reduce dose  If Hb level &gt;11 g/dL, interrupt dosing until Hb is ≤11 g/dL; decrease dose by 150 mg from previous dose Do not continue &gt;24 weeks if a clinically meaningful increase in Hb level is not achieved Alternative explanations for an inadequate response should be sought and treated before restarting therapy  
   - If Hb rises rapidly (eg, &gt;1 g/dL in any 2-week period or &gt;2 g/dL in 4 weeks), interrupt dosing or reduce dose 
   - If Hb level &gt;11 g/dL, interrupt dosing until Hb is ≤11 g/dL; decrease dose by 150 mg from previous dose
   - Do not continue &gt;24 weeks if a clinically meaningful increase in Hb level is not achieved
   - Alternative explanations for an inadequate response should be sought and treated before restarting therapy
Dosage Modifications:
  Oral iron and phosphate binders :
   - Administer vadadustat ≥1 hr before oral iron supplements, products containing iron, or iron-containing phosphate binders

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Opioid Overdose:
   - Indicated for the complete or partial reversal of opioid depression (including respiratory depression) induced by natural and synthetic opioids
   - 0.4-2 mg IV/IM/SC; repeat q2-3min PRN; not to exceed 10 mg (0.01 mg/kg)  
   - Consider other causes of respiratory depression if desired response not achieved after administering 10 mg cumulative total
   - Endotracheal (this is the least desirable route of administration and supported only by anecdotal evidence): 2-2.5 times (0.8-5 mg) initial IV dose
   - For chronic opioid abuse, use smallest doses (0.1-0.2 mg) to avoid acute withdrawal; titrate to reversal of respiratory depression
   - Following reversal, additional dose(s) may need to be administered at later interval (ie, 20 to 60 min) depending on type and duration of opioid
  Continuous IV infusion (Off-label):
   - For use in patients exposed to long acting opioids (eg, methadone), sustained release products
   - Calculate dose/hr based on effective intermittent dose used and duration of adequate response seen
   - Alternatively, use two-thirds of initial effective naloxone bolus on an hourly basis (0.25-6.25 mg/hr); administer one-half of initial bolus dose 15 min after initiating continuous IV infusion to prevent drop in naloxone levels
  Zimhi High-Dose:
   - Indicated for immediate administration as emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression
   - 5 mg IM/SC into anterolateral aspect of the thigh (through clothing if necessary); if child is &lt;1 yr, pinch the thigh muscle while administering the dose
   - Seek emergency medical care immediately after use
   - Additional doses may be administered q2-3min until EMS arrives 
Reversal of Respiratory Depression with Therapeutic Opioid Doses:
   - 0.04-0.4 mg IV/IM/SC initially; may repeat until desired response achieved; if desired response not observed after 0.8 mg total, consider other causes of respiratory depression
Postoperative Opioid Depression:
   - 0.1-0.2 mg IV q2-3min to desired degree of reversal (eg, adequate ventilation and alertness without significant pain)
   - May repeat within 1-2hr intervals depending on amount, type (eg, short or long acting) and timing of last dose administered; supplemental IM doses have produced longer lasting effects

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Opioid Reversal:
  Postanesthesia (acute) opioid reversal:
   - Neonates: 0.01 mg/kg IV into umbilical vein/IM/SC; give subsequent dose of 0.1 mg/kg if needed  
   - Children: 0.01 mg/kg IV once; may repeat with 0.1 mg/kg
  Reversal of respiratory depression with therapeutic opioid dosing:
   - Manufacturer dosing: 0.005-0.01 mg; repeat q2-3min PRN based on response
   - AAP dosing: 0.001-0.015 mg/kg/dose IV; titrate to effect  
  Acute opioid overdose:
   - ≤20 kg or &lt;5 years: 0.1 mg/kg/dose IV/IM/SC/ET; if needed, repeat q2-3min PRN; not to exceed 2 mg/dose  
   - &gt;20 kg or ≥5 years: 2 mg IV/IM/SC/ET; if needed, repeat q2-3min PRN
   - Consider endotracheal administration when IV/intraosseous route not available; optimal endotracheal dose unknown; 2-3 times the IV dose recommended 
  Zimhi High-Dose:
   - Indicated for immediate administration as emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression 
   - 5 mg IM/SC into anterolateral aspect of the thigh (through clothing if necessary); if child is &lt;1 yr, pinch the thigh muscle while administering the dose

  <rdf:hasDose>Adult Dosing Information:
Cyanide Poisoning:
   - Indicated for sequential use with sodium nitrite for the treatment of acute cyanide poisoning that is judged to be serious or life-threatening
   - When diagnosis of cyanide poisoning is uncertain, carefully weight the potential risks associated with sodium thiosulfate against potential benefits, especially if patient is not in extremis
   - Comprehensive treatment of acute cyanide intoxication requires support of vital functions; administration of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate should be considered adjunctive to appropriate supportive therapies
   - Sodium nitrite: 10 mL of sodium nitrite at a rate of 2.5-5 mL/minute
   - Sodium thiosulfate: 50 mL of sodium thiosulfate immediately following administration of sodium nitrite
   - Do not delay airway, ventilatory and circulatory support, and oxygen administration to administer sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate
   - If signs of poisoning reappear, repeat treatment using one-half original dose of both sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate
   - Expert advice from a regional poison control center may be obtained by calling 1-800-222-1222
Cisplatin Extravasation (Off-label):
   - 2 mL 1/6 molar solution through IV cannula for every 100 mg cisplatin; remove needle, then inject 0.1 mL injections clockwise around extravasation area up to 1 mL; repeat several times within the 3-4 hr of extravasation incident
   - Preparation of 1/6 Molar solution: 1.6 mL of 25% solution + 8.4 mL sterile water for injection
Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity (Off-label):
   - 4 g/m2 IV bolus followed by 12 g/m2 IV infusion over 6 hr
Orphan Designations:
   - Calciphylaxis: 25 g IV 3 times per week following dialysis for 6 weeks to 9 months; other protocols exist
   - Mechlorethamine extravasation: 2 mL 10% solution through IV cannula for every 2 mg mechlorethamine extravasated; remove needle, then inject 10 mL of 1/6 molar solution SC
   - Sulfur mustard poisoning
   - Dermatomyositis
  Orphan sponsor:
   - Hope Pharmaceuticals; 16416 N. 92nd Street, Suite 125; Scottsdale, AZ 85260
Dosing considerations:
   - Safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with sodium thiosulfate injection not established; if a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with sodium thiosulfate injection, do not administered concurrently in the same IV line
   - If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, administer sodium thiosulfate injection without delay
   - Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires
   - Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside
   - Presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown
   - Symptoms of cyanate poisoning include headache, confusion, dyspnea, chest tightness, nausea
   - Signs of cyanide poisoning include altered mental status (eg, confusion, disorientation), seizures or coma, mydriasis, tachypnea/hyperpnea, bradypnea/apnea (late), hypertension (early)/hypotension (late), cardiovascular collapse, vomiting, plasma lactate concentration &gt;8mmol/L
   - In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs; the presence of altered mental status (eg, confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well
  Smoke inhalation:
   - Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult
   - Before administering of sodium thiosulfate injection, assess smoke-inhalation victims for exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area, presence of soot around the mouth, nose, or oropharynx; altered mental status, although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims
   - Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration ≥10 mmol/L; if cyanide poisoning is suspected, do not delay treatment in order to obtain plasma lactate concentration
  Monitoring parameters:
   - Monitor for at least 24-48 hr after sodium thiosulfate for adequate oxygenation and perfusion and for recurrent signs and symptoms of cyanide toxicity
   - When possible, obtain hemoglobin/hematocrit when treatment is initiated
   - Measurements of oxygen saturation using standard pulse oximetry and calculated oxygen saturation values based on measured PO2 are unreliable in the presence of methemoglobinemia

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Cyanide Poisoning:
   - Comprehensive treatment of acute cyanide intoxication requires support of vital functions; administration of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate should be considered adjunctive to appropriate supportive therapies
   - Sodium nitrite: 0.2 mL/kg (6 mg/kg or 6-8 mL/m2 BSA) of sodium nitrite at the rate of 2.5 to 5 mL/minute not to exceed 10 mL

   - Indicated to reduce the risk of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin in pediatric patients aged 1 month and older with localized, non-metastatic solid tumors
   - Administer as IV infusion over 15 min starting 6 hr after completing cisplatin infusion
   - For multiday cisplatin regimens, administer 6 hr after each cisplatin infusion but at least 10 hr before the next cisplatin infusion
   - Do not start if &lt;10 hr before starting next cisplatin infusion
  Dose is based on surface area according to actual body weight (ABW):
   - ABW &lt;5 kg: 10 g/m2
   - ABW 5-10 kg: 15 g/m2
   - ABW &gt;10kg: 20 g/m2
Dosage Modifications :
  Pedmark:
   - Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions: Permanently discontinue
   - Hypernatremia (sodium &gt;145 mmol/L): Withhold until sodium normalizes; resume at same dose
   - Grade 3 or 4 hypokalemia: Withhold until potassium normalizes; resume at the same dose
   - Grade 3 other adverse reactions: Withhold until Grade ≤1; resume at same dose
   - Grade 4 other adverse reactions: Permanently discontinue
  Renal impairment:
   - Sodium thiosulfate is substantially excreted by the kidney
   - Mild-to-severe or end-stage renal disease: No dose adjustment necessary
   - If GFR decreased to &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypernatremia and hypokalemia more closely 
Dosing Considerations:
   - Not substitutable with other sodium thiosulfate products
  Limitations of use:
   - Safety and efficacy not established when administered following cisplatin infusions &gt;6 hr 
   - May not reduce the risk of ototoxicity when administered following longer cisplatin infusions, because irreversible ototoxicity may have already occurred
  sodium thiosulfate (generic):
   - Safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with sodium thiosulfate injection not established; if a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with sodium thiosulfate injection, do not administered concurrently in the same IV line
   - If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, administer sodium thiosulfate injection without delay
   - Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires
   - Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside
   - Presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown
   - Symptoms of cyanate poisoning include headache, confusion, dyspnea, chest tightness, nausea
   - Signs of cyanide poisoning include altered mental status (eg, confusion, disorientation), seizures or coma, mydriasis, tachypnea/hyperpnea, bradypnea/apnea (late), hypertension (early)/hypotension (late), cardiovascular collapse, vomiting, plasma lactate concentration &gt;8mmol/L
   - In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs; the presence of altered mental status (eg, confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well
   -  Smoke inhalation Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult Before administering of sodium thiosulfate injection, assess smoke-inhalation victims for exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area, presence of soot around the mouth, nose, or oropharynx; altered mental status, although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration ≥10 mmol/L; if cyanide poisoning is suspected, do not delay treatment in order to obtain plasma lactate concentration

DVT &amp; PE:
  Prophylaxis:
   - 5000 units SC q8-12hr, OR
   - 7500 units SC q12hr
  Treatment:
   - 80 units/kg IV bolus, THEN continuous infusion of 18 units/kg/hr, OR  
   - 5000 units IV bolus, THEN continuous infusion of 1300 units/hr, OR
   - 250 units/kg (alternatively, 17,500 units) SC, THEN 250 units/kg q12hr
  Dosing considerations:
   - Numerous concentrations available; extreme caution is required to avoid medication error
Acute Coronary Syndromes:
  PCI:
   - Without GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor: Initial IV bolus of 70-100 units/kg (target ACT 250-300 sec)  
   - With GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor: Initial IV bolus of 50-70 units/kg (target ACT &gt;200 sec)
  STEMI :
   - Patient on fibrinolytics: IV bolus of 60 units/kg (max: 4000 units), THEN 12 units/kg/hr (max 1000 units/hr) as continuous IV infusion
   - Dose should be adjusted to maintain aPTT of 50-70 sec
  Unstable Angina/NSTEMI:
   - Initial IV bolus of 60-70 units/kg (max: 5000 units), THEN initial IV infusion of 12-15 units/kg/hr (max: 1000 units/hr)
   - Dose should be adjusted to maintain aPTT of 50-70 sec
  Dosing considerations:
   - Numerous concentrations available; extreme caution is required to avoid medication error
Anticoagulation:
  Intermittent IV injection:
   - 8000-10,000 units IV initially, THEN 50-70 units/kg (5000-10,000 units) q4-6hr  
  Continuous IV infusion:
   - 5000 units IV injection, followed by continuous IV infusion of 20,000-40,000 units/24 hr
  Dosing considerations:
   - Numerous concentrations available; extreme caution is required to avoid medication error
   - Heparin sodium may prolong one-stage prothrombin time; when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hr after last intravenous dose or 24 hr after last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained
Catheter Patency:
   - Prevention of clot formation within venous and arterial catheters
   - Use 100 units/mL; instill enough volume to fill lumen of catheter
  Dosing considerations:
   - Numerous concentrations available; extreme caution is required to avoid medication error
   - Amount and frequency depends on catheter volume and type
   - Peripheral heparin locks typically are flushed q6-8hr
Dosing Modifications:
   - Hepatic impairment: Caution is advised; dosage adjustment may be required

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Venous Thromboembolic Prophylaxis (Off-label):
   - 100-150 units/kg IV once  
Venous Thromboembolic Treatment (Off-label):
  &lt;1 year:
   - Loading dose of 75 units/kg IV, THEN 28 units/kg/hr IV as initial maintenance dose  
  &gt;1 year:
   - Loading dose of 75 units/kg IV, THEN 20 units/kg/hr IV as initial maintenance dose
  Intermittent IV injection:
   - Initially give 50-100 units/kg IV infusion, THEN 100 units/kg IV infusion q4hr as a maintenance dose
Catheter Patency (Off-label):
   - Initially give 50-100 units/kg IV infusion, THEN 100 units/kg IV infusion q4hr as maintenance dose  
   - Infants under 10 kg: 10 units/mL; instill enough volume to fill lumen of catheter
   - Children and infants over 10 kg: 10-100 units/mL; instill enough volume to fill lumen of catheter
Dosing Considerations:
   - Numerous concentrations available; extreme caution is required to avoid medication error
   - When prescribing in infants, consider combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection (contains 9.45 mg of benzyl alcohol) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol; the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known
   - There are no adequate, well-controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients; pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience
   - Use preservative-free heparin in neonates and infants; benzyl alcohol preservative has been associated with serious adverse effects (ie, gasping syndrome, which is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations) and death in pediatric patients
  Venous thromboembolic treatment (off-label):
   - Adjust heparin dose based on desired aPTT
  Catheter patency (off-label):
   - Dosage amount and frequency depend on catheter volume and type
   - Peripheral heparin locks typically are flushed q6-8hr</rdf:hasDose></rdf:Description>

Leprosy:
   - Indicated for treatment of lepromatous leprosy, including dapsone-resistant leprosy complicated by erythema nodosum leprosum
   - No longer commercially available in the United States; only available by obtaining an investigational new drug (IND), see Dosing Considerations
   - Preferably used in combination with 1 or more other antileprosy agents to prevent the emergence of drug resistance
   - Most patients today are treated with dapsone and rifampin, and, in multibacillary cases, clofazimine
  Dapsone-sensitive multibacillary leprosy:
   - 50 mg PO qDay in combination with dapsone 100 mg/day and rifampicin 600 mg/day
   - Administer for at least 2 years and continued, if possible, until negative skin smears are obtained
   - At this time, monotherapy with an appropriate antileprosy drug can be instituted
   - Well tolerated when dose does not exceed 100 mg/day
  Dapsone-resistant leprosy:
   - 100 mg PO qDay in combination with 1 or more other antileprosy drugs for 3 years, followed by monotherapy with 100 mg of clofazimine daily
   - Clinical improvement usually can be detected within 1-3 months of treatment and is usually clearly evident by the 6 months
Dosage Modifications:
  Erythema nodosum leprosum reactions:
   - Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms
   - Basic antileprosy treatment should be continued, and if nerve injury or skin ulceration is threatened, corticosteroids should be given
   - Where prolonged corticosteroid therapy becomes necessary, clofazimine administered at dosages of 100 to 200 mg daily for up to 3 months may be useful in eliminating or reducing corticosteroid requirements
   - Dosages &gt;200 mg/day are not recommended
   - Taper dose to 100 mg/day as quickly as possible after the reactive episode is controlled
  Hepatic impairment:
   - Child-Pugh Class A, B, and C: Avoid therapy unless benefit outweighs risk
  Renal impairment:
   - Mild to moderate: Dose adjustment not necessary
   - Severe: Use caution
Dosing Considerations:
   - No longer commercially available in the United States
   - Clofazimine can be obtained by submitting an IND through the National Hansen’s Disease (Leprosy) Program (NHDP)
   - The prescriber is considered to be an investigator and must submit an FDA form 1572 and curriculum vitae to the National Hansen’s Disease Program from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

Chronic Kidney Disease-Associated Anemia:
  CKD not on dialysis :
   - Consider initiating ESA treatment only when the hemoglobin level is &lt;10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:
   - 1) The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a red blood cell transfusion; and
   - 2) Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other red blood cell transfusion-related risks is a goal
   - If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt ESA dose and use the lowest dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions
   - Recommended starting dose: 0.45 mcg/kg IV/SC q4weeks  
  CKD on dialysis :
   - Initiate ESA treatment when the hemoglobin level is &lt;10 g/dL
   - If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of ESA
   - Recommended starting dose: 0.45 mcg/kg IV or SC qWeek or 0.75 mcg/kg q2weeks; the IV route is recommended for patietns on hemodialysis  
   - Intravenous route recommended for patients on hemodialysis
  Dose adjustment &amp; monitoring:
   - Evaluate iron status before and during treatment and maintain iron repletion
   - When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly
   - When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability
   - A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change
   - Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks
   - Decreases in dose can occur more frequently; avoid frequent dose adjustment
   - If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (eg, more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses
   - For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%
  Dosing information:
   - For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks
   - Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions
   - Evaluate other causes of anemia
   - Discontinue if responsiveness does not improve
   - Hemoglobin target removed from labeling: The drug label previously recommended that ESAs should be dosed to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range of 10-12 g/dL in CKD patients; this target concept is now removed from the labeling
   - Withhold dose if Hgb continues to increase after dosage decrease
   - Monitor: Hgb, iron, Hct, renal function
Chemotherapy-Related Anemia with Nonmyeloid Malignancies:
   - 2.25 mcg/kg SC qWeek OR 500 mcg SC q3Weeks  
   - If Hgb increases &lt;1 g/dL after 6 weeks, may increase dose no more than 4.5 mcg/kg
   - Reduce dose by 40% if rapid increase in Hgb (eg, &gt;1 g/dL in 2-week period)
   - Discontinue if no response after 8 weeks

Pediatric Dosing Information:
Chronic Kidney Disease-Associated Anemia:
   - ≥1 month:
   - Initiate treatment when the hemoglobin level is &lt;10 g/dL
   - If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 12 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose
   - Recommended starting dose for pediatric patients (&lt;18 yr) is 0.45 mcg/kg SC or IV qWeek
   - Patients not receiving dialysis may also be initiated at a dose of 0.75 mcg/kg q2Week
  Conversion from epoetin alfa :
   - EPO 1500-2499 unit/week: 6.25 mcg/week SC
   - EPO 2500-4999 unit/week: 10 mcg/week SC
   - EPO 5000-10,999 unit/week: 20 mcg/week SC
   - EPO 11,000-17,999 unit/week: 40 mcg/week SC

   - EPO 34,000-89,999 unit/week: 100 mcg/week SC
   - EPO 90,000 unit/week or greater: 200 mcg/week SC
  Dosage modification:
   - Reduce dose by 25% if rapid increase in Hgb (eg, &gt;1 g/dL in 2-week period)
   - If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of ESA

Bile Acid Synthesis Disorders:
   - Indicated for bile acid synthesis disorders due to single-enzyme defects (SEDs)
   - 10-15 mg/kg/day PO qDay or divided BID
Peroxisomal Disorders:
   - Indicated for adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders (PDs), including Zellweger spectrum disorders in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease, steatorrhea, or complications from decreased fat-soluble vitamin absorption
   - 10-15 mg/kg/day PO qDay or divided BID
Dosage Modifications:
  Familial hypertriglyceridemia:
   - Patients with newly diagnosed or a family history of familial hypertriglyceridemia may have poor absorption of cholic acid from the intestine and require a 10% increase in the recommended dosage to account for losses due to malabsorption
   - Recommended dosage range: 11-17 mg/kg/day PO qDay or divided BID
   - Determine adequacy of the dosage regimen by monitoring clinical response, including steatorrhea, and laboratory values, including transaminases, bilirubin, and PT/INR
Dosing Considerations:
   - Safety and effectiveness on extrahepatic manifestations of bile acid synthesis disorders due to SEDs or PDs have not been established
  Monitoring:
   - Monitor AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and INR every month for the first 3 months; every 3 months for the next 9 months; every 6 months during the subsequent 3 yr; and annually thereafter
   - Monitor more frequently during periods of rapid growth, concomitant disease, or pregnancy
   - Administer the lowest dose that effectively maintains liver function
   - Discontinue treatment if liver function does not improve within 3 months of the start of treatment or complete biliary obstruction develops
   - Discontinue treatment at any time if there are persistent clinical or laboratory indicators of worsening liver function or cholestasis
   - Concurrent elevations of GGT and ALT may indicate overdose; continue to monitor laboratory parameters of liver function and consider restarting at a lower dose when the parameters return to baseline
   - Serum or urinary bile acid level using mass spectrometry is used in the diagnosis of bile acid synthesis disorders due to SEDs and PDs, including Zellweger spectrum disorders
   - The utility of bile acid measurements in monitoring the clinical course of patients and in decisions regarding dose adjustment has not been demonstrated

   - CrCl ≥60 mL/min: Dose adjustment not necessary
   - CrCl &lt;60 mL/min: Do not use for pre-exposure prophylaxis
   - If a decrease in estimated CrCl observed in an uninfected individual while taking emtricitabine/tenofovir DF for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate potential causes and reassess potential risks and benefits of continued use
  Hepatic impairment:
   - No substantial alterations in tenofovir pharmacokinetics observed in clinical trials in subjects with hepatic impairment compared with unimpaired subjects
   - Pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied with hepatic impairment; however, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolized by liver enzymes, so the impact of liver impairment should be limited
Dosing Considerations:
   - All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating
   - Before initiating and during use, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients; in patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus
  HIV infection:
   - Not recommended for use as a component of a triple nucleoside regimen
   - Should not be coadministered with combination products that are complete regimens or already contain emtricitabine or tenofovir (eg, Atripla, Complera, Emtriva, Genvoya, Odefsey, Stribild, Viread)
   - Do not coadminister with lamivudine-containing products (eg, Epivir, Combivir, Dutrebis, Epzicom, Triumeq, Trizivir) because of similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine
   - In treatment experienced patients, use should be guided by laboratory testing and treatment history
  PrEP:
   - Individuals must have a negative HIV-1 test immediately prior to initiating emtricitabine/tenofovir AF for HIV-1
   - If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (&lt;1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least 1 month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection
   - Continuing screening at least once q3months while taking emtricitabine/tenofovir AF

Pediatric Dosing Information:
HIV Infection:
   - Weight &lt;17 kg: Safety and efficacy not established
   - Indicated in combination with other ART agents for children weighing at least 17 kg who can swallow the tablet whole
  Weight ≥17 kg :
   - 17 to &lt;22 kg: One 100 mg/150 mg tablet PO qDay
   - 22 to &lt;28 kg: One 133 mg/200 mg tablet PO qDay
   - 28 to &lt;35 kg: One 167 mg/250 mg tablet PO qDay
   - ≥35 kg: One 200 mg/300 mg tablet PO qDay
HIV-1 Pre-exposure Prophylaxis :
   - Indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg
   - &lt;35 kg: Safety and efficacy not established
   - ≥35 kg: One 200 mg/300 mg tablet PO qDay
  PrEP indications (CDC guidelines) :
   - Men who have sex with men (MSM) at substantial risk of HIV acquisition
   - Adult heterosexually active men and women at substantial risk of HIV acquisition
   - Adult injection drug users (IDU) at substantial risk of HIV acquisition
   - Heterosexually-active women and men whose partners are known to have HIV infection (ie, HIV-discordant couples) to protect the uninfected partner during conception and pregnancy so that an informed decision can be made in awareness of what is known and unknown about benefits and risks of PrEP for mother and fetus
  Factors that help identify individuals at high risk for HIV:
   - Has partner(s) known to be HIV-1 infected or engages in sexual activity within a high prevalence area or social network and 1 or more of the following
   - Factors Inconsistent or no condom use Diagnosis or sexually transmitted infections Exchange of sex for commodities (eg, money, food, shelter, drugs) Illicit drug use or alcohol dependence Incarceration Partner(s) of unknown HIV-1 status with any of the risk factors listed above 
   - Inconsistent or no condom use
   - Diagnosis or sexually transmitted infections
   - Exchange of sex for commodities (eg, money, food, shelter, drugs)
   - Illicit drug use or alcohol dependence
   - Incarceration
   - Partner(s) of unknown HIV-1 status with any of the risk factors listed above
Dosage Modifications:
  Renal impairment:
   - No data are available to make dosage recommendations in pediatric patients infected with HIV-1 infection who have renal impairment
   - PrEP CrCl ≥60 mL/min or greater: Dose adjustment not necessary CrCl &lt;60 mL/min: Do not use for pre-exposure prophylaxis If a decrease in estimated CrCl observed in an uninfected individual while taking emtricitabine/tenofovir DF for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate potential causes and reassess potential risks and benefits of continued use 
   - CrCl ≥60 mL/min or greater: Dose adjustment not necessary
   - CrCl &lt;60 mL/min: Do not use for pre-exposure prophylaxis
   - If a decrease in estimated CrCl observed in an uninfected individual while taking emtricitabine/tenofovir DF for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate potential causes and reassess potential risks and benefits of continued use
  Hepatic impairment:
   - No substantial alterations in tenofovir pharmacokinetics observed in clinical trials in subjects with hepatic impairment compared with unimpaired subjects
   - Pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied with hepatic impairment; however, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolized by liver enzymes, so the impact of liver impairment should be limited
Dosing Considerations:
   - All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating
   - Before initiating and during use, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients; in patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus
  HIV infection:
   - Not recommended for use as a component of a triple nucleoside regimen
   - Should not be coadministered with combination products that are complete regimens or already contain emtricitabine or tenofovir (eg, Atripla, Complera, Emtriva, Genvoya, Odefsey, Stribild, Viread)
   - Do not coadminister with lamivudine-containing products (eg, Epivir, Combivir, Dutrebis, Epzicom, Triumeq, Trizivir) because of similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine
   - In treatment experienced patients, use should be guided by laboratory testing and treatment history
  PrEP:
   - Individuals must have a negative HIV-1 test immediately prior to initiating emtricitabine/tenofovir AF for HIV-1 PrEP
   - If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (&lt;1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least 1 month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection
   - Continuing screening at least once q3months while taking emtricitabine/tenofovir AF</rdf:hasDose></rdf:Description>
